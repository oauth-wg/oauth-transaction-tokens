This is not unlike the problems we see with wallets and the need for some way to let clients authenticate without being pre-registered. \r\n\r\nI wonder if we can remove this requirement and instead rely on some form of authentication where the trust is in the credential issuer. For example, with SPIFFE, there is an authority that issues the credential to the workload, so as long as the client presents a credential issued by the authority, it could be trusted (provided the authority is trusted).

If all services operate within the same trust boundary, they already know their trusted authorization server and an iss claim would just add clutter and unnecessary data to the token. Also it would mean that one had to already trust some data within the transaction token before being able to validate its signature. This could lead to a rogue component to send requests to an internal service with carefully crafted transaction tokens with an iss pointing to another server the rogue component has control over. To prevent injecting rogue iss, the internal service would need to validate the provided iss value with a preconfigured list of allowed ones.\r\n\r\nIn our environment (trust boundary) where we are using internal tokens for transactions, the internal services have the authorization server's host name configured. Internal services can decide to pull (and cache) the jwks from the well-known url and validate the tokens locally or they can use the token introspection endpoint of the authorization server for validating the token. Validating the internal/transaction tokens with token introspection is useful for some sensitive operations and has the benefit that this validation can fail if for instance the access token the transaction token was derived from got revoked or the authentication context associated with the tokens got flagged.\r\n",

Those formats could not be verified (e.g. signature check) by the workloads locally, but would require incorporating Token Introspection to get the data. For performance reasons, the format should at least be defined as self contained and verifiable locally. CWT as well as (SD-)JWT would have these properties. In the IETF meeting protobuf was mentioned. As far as I know, protobuf does not have this property, so I don't see it as a fitting candidate.\r\n\r\nWe also need to consider interoperability. If the spec allowed for multiple formats (or even leaves the format out of the specification), generic libraries/frameworks to implement the protocol would need to support not just one but a lot of formats or even make the format (serialization/deserialization) pluggable. Although this might be a good idea anyway, it tends to be more complex.\r\n\r\nIn regards to selective disclosure: The purpose of the transaction token is to pass it along the transaction call chain. So if there is specific data of the original presented Access Token not to be disclosed in the transaction token, the TTS would simply not add it in the transaction token when issuing it. Although a workload can choose to exchange the transaction token for another one, the purpose was to narrow the scope to further limit the access which the new transaction token could be used for. At this point the new transaction token could contain even less information than the original transaction token. I don't think that there should be more information disclosed at this point. That's why I don't think that SD-JWTs would have an application here.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I do see an application for a transaction token which contains specific information for specific workloads along the call chain. I can see some similarities to Rich Authorization Requests (RAR) where there can be PII/resource identifiers in the transaction token which should only be visible to some workloads even if the transaction token is passed along through all participating workloads.\r\n",

The only alternative in the OAuth world I could think of is the Client Credentials Grant, but it doesn't specify how to push transaction-specific data. Also, the result will be an Access Token and not a Txn-Token, which assumes that downstream workloads must be able to understand both.\r\n\r\nMaybe slightly unrelated, but it is also a bit unclear how should we communicate the desired `azd` and `purp` to the Txn-Token Service?

As it has been established that requesting Txn-Tokens without an external trigger is needed. however, the current spec requires an Access token to be presented in the subject_token parameter and the question is, how an internal batch process would obtain this. @dteguin (and me in the related issue #62) mentioned Client credentials grant for obtaining the AT. However, client credentials grant based ATs may not be related to users referred to with the sub claim, so it may be a challenge to issue Txn-Tokens with a user-related sub when the client credentials grant based AT does not contain one.\r\n\r\nIn #62 I gave an example where a batch processor might be able to present an expired Txn-Token, but there are still scenarios where no AT can be presented in the subject_token parameter or where the presented subject_token does not contain the information necessary to fill and issue the Txn-Token. This information needs to be provided somehow to the TTS. If this information must be part of the subject_token or somehow be obtainable by the TTS via parts of the subject_token content, it should at least be mentioned in the spec.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd like to see an option where the TTS can be called without a subject_token as input and instead providing the necessary information via additional parameters (e.g. sub within the req_ctx). It goes without saying, that this type of Token issuance should only be allowed to a very limited set of authenticated clients which have a special trust relationship with the TTS.",

However, I think that creating long-living Access Tokens just for the purpose of exchanging them for short-lived Txn-Tokens and then throwing them away can be considered wasteful (energy costs). Every internally originating job would need at least two calls instead of just one to obtain the Txn-Token.\r\n\r\nKeeping those long-living Access Tokens around to re-use them for longer time is usually not useful for batch processes as those processes operate on a lot of user accounts in quick succession. Maintaining all those Access Tokens in memory is often not feasible. Neither is a storage system. I also think that using long-living Access Tokens in this scenario can add security risks. Those Access Tokens could leak and another party could use them to create Txn-Tokens or access resources the Access Token was meant for.\r\n\r\nIn our own implementation of a Txn-Service, the Txn-Service (Token Exchange) is also providing the Token endpoint and allows specific internal clients to use the Client Credentials Grant Type (mTLS client certificates) to obtain Txn-Tokens right away. The necessary input parameters are essentially a combination of the Token Request based on Client Credentials Grant and Token Exchange with a Txn-Token profile.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to extend the Txn-Token Service interface to allow Txn-Token Requests without the Access Token as input? This would essentially mean to define a Txn-Token profile for the Token endpoint in addition to the Token Exchange protocol.",

          "body": "So a couple of thoughts here:\r\n\r\n1. I believe the Txn-Token Service (TTS) must be able to issue Txn-Tokens without a previously issued access_token. Think about a use case where email is being delivered to a mail box. SMTP does not carry the access token that authorized the sending of the email. In that context, the in-bound email server needs to be able to request a Txn-Token for the purpose of delivering the email to the specified inbox.\r\n2. The general intent for keeping Txn-Tokens very short lived is to remove the need for revocation. Revocation is difficult for any token system (see the issuer-holder-verifier efforts in this space). Given that the vast majority of transactions complete in a very short timeframe, keeping the life-time of the Txn-Token short makes a lot of sense.\r\n3. There are some edge cases where a longer lived Txn-Token may be beneficial or required.  Say for instance a user asks for their account to be deleted (GDPR) and the Txn-Token needs to live for multiple days? even though the underlying identity system may have cleaned up the user identifier data. That said, these edge cases should be vetted very carefully as there is a security risk if a Txn-Token lives for a long time and hence can be replayed potentially in compromising ways.",

          "body": "The use cases you mention are pretty much what we had to implement.\r\n\r\n1. For incoming mails we have a mail delivery agent which wants to use the mail storage system service to store the mail in the user mailbox. In order to write to the mailbox of a user, the delivery agent needs a Txn-Token with the sub of the user. The delivery agent asks the TTS about a Txn-Token and presents its client credentials and the mail address of the recipient/user. The TTS allows issuing Txn-Tokens to the delivery agent. There is no long-living access token involved. The issued Txn-Token is short lived (1 minute in our deployments).\r\n\r\n3. Whenever a user cancels their contract, we have to keep the data for some time (number of days depending on type of data, legal restrictions, etc.) after the delete operations are performed. The delayed delete operation is done by batch processes. Now, instead of creating and storing long-living access tokens which could be leaked and abused elsewhere, we decided to retain the short-lived Txn-Tokens and allow only those batch processes to ask the TTS to issue new Txn-Tokens for already expired Txn-Tokens to perform the actual delete operation which requires a valid and not expired Txn-Token when calling the storage system services.\r\n\r\nSo my argument is against using (and potentially abusing) long-living access tokens, and instead for allowing expired Txn-Tokens to be presented to the TTS to re-issue Txn-Tokens for the purpose of finalizing a delayed operation.",

My point was to only allow specific authenticated clients the exchange of expired TraTs. It is true that if those clients get hacked themselves (and the client authentication can be done by an attacker) new TraTs can be created and abused.\r\n\r\nHowever, longer living TraTs have also the risk of being abused with replay attacks. I think the risk for replay attacks with longer living TraTs is even higher as an attacker would just need to get hold of the long-living TraTs and does not have the need to renew it.\r\n",

          "body": "Indeed, the spec does not say anything about whether and how the TTS is validating the txn token before issuing a replacement txn-token. So presenting an already expired txn-token can be accepted based on the authenticated client, purpose and scope. After all, it can be a specifically defined policy.\r\n\r\nI recommend that we at least acknowledge this case in the spec and give guidance when to use it. As we also have the case of not presenting any token when requesting a txn-token (see #53), I think that as long as a workload is in possession of a txn-token - even if it is expired - we should recommend to present it when requesting replacement txn-tokens. It should be the decision of the TTS whether to accept the expired txn-token and not of the workload (the workload could just take the subject from the expired token and present it as the subject_token to the TTS).\r\n\r\nOne additional aspect came to our attention. There are actually two cases for expired txn-tokens:\r\n\r\n1. The exp claim says it is expired, but the signature is still valid\r\n2. The signature is not valid (anymore) as the key used to sign the token is not available anymore\r\n\r\nDepending on how frequently a TTS is rotating its key material, the second case might occur for such long running processes like deleting account data several weeks after the customer has cancelled their contract. For instance our TTS implementation is rotating the keys daily. Only the next, current and previous signing keys are provided to workloads (via JWKS uri). Even if a workload is not able to verify the signature of a txn-token it received several weeks ago, the TTS might still be able to keep the old key material for a longer period so that it can at least validate the signature of those txn-tokens.\r\n",

It contains the trust domain. To my understanding, every trust domain has a single (logical) Txn-Service. A Txn-Service is usually configured to only issue Txn-Tokens to one and only one trust domain. Also the authenticating clients which the Txn-Service accepts in incoming requests are part of that trust domain. After all, they have been registered within that trust domain. It might be possible that the Txn-Service is used in multiple trust domains. In those scenarios I fully agree that the audience parameter is REQUIRED. My guess is, though, that the most deployed setup will incorporate a single trust domain.",

Also, if it is defined as REQUIRED, it will be enforced by 3rd party libraries which a company might want to integrate in their components/services. This essentially forces the company (albeit using Txn-Tokens within their trust domain only internally) to define and set the aud claim without added benefit.\r\n\r\nHaving aud REQUIRED also implies that the value needs to be validated somehow. I think this aspect should be mentioned in the spec, if it is really required.

It has less to do with the AS in that case\r\n- (George) In that context, if my workload needs to initiate 3 different types of transactions by calling 3 different workloads, my service would still go to the TTS to get a TraT for each use case. In the Lambda case, one could provision the Lambda with a pre-injected TraT. A Kubernetes WL would get a workload token at startup, but would need a TraT per request.\r\n- (Justin) Agree that these are two different things. There isn't going to be just one way for this to show up at runtime. This is different from access tokens\r\n- (Pieter) We could have at least one TTS per cluster. Having it called out that it can be standalone, or a part of the AS will be interesting. We should call out the security considerations of standalone, so that we don't redo all the work that AS security considerations already cover\r\n- (Pieter) In WIMSE, a deliverable is local token issuance. There's a model where the TraT is embedded in the workload (the workload is self-issuing)\r\n- (George) One of the reasons to create this issue is to collect these ideas. We could collect these  different ideas, and discuss in Vancouver. People who have deployed something similar already would be useful to get feedback from.\r\n- (Atul) Can we individually contribute slides that can be discussed in Vancouver?\r\n- (Justin) Are we collecting these in a Wiki page, or a temporary section of the document that we know we are going to discard.\r\n- (George) We should just add it to this issue.\r\n- (Pieter) We should raise this both in the WIMSE and the OAuth WG in Vancouver\r\n- ",

B is compromised and generates dummy tokens to request informations from other workloads that in fact accept dummy tokens? \r\n\r\nMaybe this question is leading to the next one:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHow are dummy tokens distinguished from real ones?

If C is validating token, then it can deny request. If C is more of an intermediate passthrough type service, then C will rely on D to deny/allow, in which case B has to send a token.\r\n\r\n> How are dummy tokens distinguished from real ones? Is there a risk developers by mistake consider dummy tokens as trusted?\r\n\r\nYes, that is the most important aspect. In general, as Hyrum's law suggests, once token is out there, we won't be able to control who uses it for what purpose. Our recommendation can be that - a token validator (e.g. Service D) MUST always use the claims in token ONLY IF validate signature exists. So that even if Service B signs it, D must deny request saying you (service B) isn't valid Tx Token service. Anyways, even if we don't specify the idea of dummy token here, someone (service B or C), can potentially overwrite the header value with its own Tx token string. \r\n\r\n",

Although we have some workloads which already receive, validate and forward TraTs, they are being called by other workloads which do not present TraTs yet and on the other end, they call other workloads which just ignore the TraTs and don't pass them along yet. So during this rollout phase (which can take months or even years) it is quite common that TraTs are getting lost frequently and no workload can actually enforce TraT validation.\r\n\r\nHowever, we do not think that any workload should be able to create its own dummy TraT just to fill the gap. We think that only the TraT Service should have the authority to issue TraTs even for those cases where gaps need to be filled. This scenario is similar to presenting self-signed tokens to the TraT Service which then issues TraTs to the requestors. The TraT Service decides which client is allowed to present self-signed tokens. While deployment is progressing the number of allowed clients will be reduced over time.",

If you rotate key at time T1 and Tx token services starts to issue tokens with new key at same time, we have to callout that it should do it at T1+X where X is the SLA for ensuring all services that validate signature will receive the new public key to verify signature. Keys can be shared out of band. One idea is to generate two pairs and two corresponding public keys will be available with services all the time. Tx Token service will have two private pairs available. Lets say PrvtKey-1 and PrvtKey-2 are with issuers. PrvtKey-1 should be used from T1 to T1+24hrs and Key-2 from T1+24 to T1+48hrs. When Tx token switches from Key-1 to 2, it doesn't have to worry about some service not having public key for key-2 to validate the token. This way key synchronization is out of band + key rotation happens frequently which keeps key rotation machinery well-tested. Generally there is no need to rotate key every 24hrs so we can choose to relax that but even if we have to force rotate key then we have to make sure force rotated key (i.e new key pair) should be used to mint tokens only when we can guarantee that those tokens can be validated.",

If a set of microservices was just passing Access Tokens, it would still be parsing and verifying the signatures on those. Now it is verifying signatures on transaction tokens instead. Although there might be a small increase, it may not be an order of magnitude (unless access tokens was passed around and not verified, which may be true for TraTs as well). I would also hesitate to provide guidance on which cryptographic algorithms to use, especially as new post quantum algorithms are going to be around. \n\nSome thoughts:\n\n(1) Add a section on key rotation and reference existing RFCs (e.g. key rotation should be performed according to guidelines in RFC.... and RFC....)\n(2) Don't make any recommendations on crypto algorithms.",

Its' valid only in Tx token service. We can encrypt it or but won't signature just suffice?\r\n\r\n@gffletch About your comment - \"I think this 'batch token' should also be sender constrained in some way.\"\r\n\r\nAshay: The way we implemented this is by creating a unique use case id or you call it namespace. So, the problem is -> A requests a batch token which it can pass to B but B would need some permissions to get Tx token back from A's batch token. To solve it, when A onboards Tx Token issuer, it creates a use case id unique to A which is registered with Tx token issuer. Every time Tx Token issuer issues a 'batch token' to A, it will find the usecaseId and put it in batch token. If B gets batch token from A (or steals it somehow), then B will not be able to get a Tx token back from issuer. Tx token issuer maintains an allowlist against each unique usecaseId, for who is allowed to get token back for that use case it. To get token back, B has to register itself to Tx token issuer against A's usecaseId.\r\n\r\nWe call services like A, the \"batch token initiator\" and services like B \"the batch rehydrator\" as it rehydates Tx token back from batch token. \r\n\r\nEdge case - A can play both roles - initiator and rehydrator. This might lead to problem of infinite exchanges. But not sure if its a problem. It may be a problem for some use case. Tx token can also keep a counter in batch token and Tx token to ensure only finite amount of exchanges are allowed.\r\n\r\nOverall, how does the proposal sound? I think we cannot write all this into a complexity into RFC. For RFC, we can keep it simple that there can be long lived batch token and Tx token must implement some sort of access control to ensure only authorized services can convert the batch to Tx token.\r\n\r\nSupporting batch has been super important for my company and major milestone as many critical workflows are model on such event based architecture. \r\n\r\nIf everything looks good, I can create PR for it and take a stab at updating our draft.",

Rather than introducing ..., we formulate a different view about expiry\r\n- (Atul): TraTs have a freedom because they are short lived. Can we have a separate mechanism for handling long-lived transactions\r\n- (George): How do we address long lived transactions? We can say that is not TraTs, but some other mechanism, similar to the work done in the ID-Chaining. Have some sort of assertion grant that can be used to mint a new transaction token.\r\n- (Joe): What about a one-time voucher? That keeps the context across separate transactions\r\n- (Pieter): Is that just a refresh token? \r\n- (Joe): You may not be granted ...\r\n- (Ashay): How we thought about it: We never changed the definition of the TraT (it always expires quickly - short lived). The service would request a new token before the TraT expiry, which mints something else that can be used to mint a new TraT later. If the claims in the TraT need to be \"refreshed\" / modified, then the TraT service. In the issuance of the voucher, the TraT service can mark certain fields as \"updateable\". You mark the fields as refreshable in the beginning, when the TraT is being issued.\r\n- (Pieter): I want to get George's thoughts on whether the short-livedness is ...\r\n- (George): A long-lived part starts to pull in revocation, which makes things complicated. For example, if a user has consented to using certain data for marketing, and when the transaction resumes, the user has rescinded the consent. What happens then?\r\n- (Pieter) The revocation argument is good. Having a token that never expires could be very problematic.\r\n- (George): What Ashay is describing is similar to what Joe described by way of \"vouchers\". In that context, the TraTs are still short-lived, which means that we should look at this as something that is layered above TraTs\r\n- (Atul): I felt the same, but the fields need to be marked updateable at the time of TraT issuance\r\n- (George): It seems the TraT service would then need to know more than just about authorization. If say, I wanted to tokenize PII, then the TraT service would need connections to a lot of other places. This could be 3 layers down in the transaction, the workload 3 levels down now puts the voucher in the batch stream. How does the TraT service know how to refresh that data?\r\n- (Pieter): I remember we had text in section 2.3 about lifetime. You cannot extend the TraT to beyond the lifetime of the original access token, so there is an upper bound. If we start tinkering with that, we have an issue. Allowing TraTs to be refreshed are goign to have downstream effects.\r\n- (Ashay): In our implementations, it gathers context from other services before requesting a new TraT\r\n- (Atul): I was going to do the same thing.\r\n- (George): The thing that needs the TraT can get the refreshed versions of the data, and pass that in the request context object, and request the new token. From a standards perspective, we need to understand what this would mean.\r\n- (Atul): ...\r\n- (Ashay): Teams responsible for specific functions can't be responsible for rebuilding the context. So we start with everything being immutable, and it can evolve as the business needs become apparent. So by default nothing is mutable.\r\n- (Ashay): How does this work? It is going to complicate the spec, can you change an RFC?\r\n- (Atul): No\r\n- (George): We can have a separate RFC which says how we should use TraTs for batching. I do think that since we are moving toward event driven models, this is important as a capability. \r\n- (Atul): Is TraTs without batching a valuable spec (can it be used without batching?)\r\n- (George): There are a lot of use cases where TraTs can be used today (without batching).\r\n- (Joe): There's also a big push for autonomous agents, (not just batch). \r\n- (George): The agent question is very interesting, but it feels like a layer on top of TraTs\r\n- (Pieter): I think TraTs are valuable as they are today. But we will almost certainly have to do a follow on spec. Can we have a proper problem definition that we can do a write up. That's the kind of thing that opens up security issues. In section 2.3 (expiry)\r\n- (Ashay): We did implement TraTs first, but the async question came up later, and it broke things that required batch processes. A call chain will almost always include some batch processes. At the beginning of the transaction, no one knows how long it is going to last\r\n- (George):  I agree. For the API invocation use case, you can look at your SLA and make good assumptions about transaction duration, but that only covers 80% of the transactions in an enterprise. But I have a lot of questions about how you build that layering in an industry standard way. So in your example, what is coming to \"workload 3\" in is a TraT, and it needs a voucher to rebuild a TraT later, which goes on the queue. Then when \"workload 4\" picks it up, and this can happen again downstream. We need to think through all those implications, and understand what they mean. It sounds like Ashay has a lot of use cases, but we need to define a lot of use cases.\r\n- (Ashay): Since this topic is so complex, it is good for us to provide guidance.\r\n- (Ashay): Can we just add expiry to each TraT field? \r\n- (Pieter): Does this modify the expiry property of the token?\r\n- (Ashay): This is not modifying the expiry of the token. \r\n- (George): So we have the rctx, if we say nothing about it, then anyone could ..\r\n- (George): The tctx is just a JSON blob, so you could put anything you want there. So another spec could define the expiry field in that.\r\n- (Pieter): Can I ask a question? We could have a situation where the TraT has expired, but the data context hasn't expired. So there is a new concept that the data expiry is longer than TraT expiry.\r\n- (Ashay): The real-world example is user consent. So EU allows 24 hours to enforce change. If a queue takes 6 days, then the new TraT has to refresh the new consent property.\r\n- (Pieter): \r\n- (George): ",

I should note that as we started to implement transaction tokens within our system environment we soon hit the road block of internal services which wanted to enforce transaction tokens when being called that this could not be done as those services where not only called by frontend systems with authenticated users, but also by batch processes or delayed process workers (typical when working with event driven processing, like Kafka). This hurdle resulted in us delaying the entire rollout of transaction tokens and we wanted to wait for the issue to be solved within the IETF draft before trying to cook something by ourselves.\n\nWe still consider batch processing and delayed processing as an essential part of transaction tokens and feel that it will essentially be incomplete or of less use when being left out.

A transaction token should have a very fine-grained purpose and most scope values are not fine-grained. \r\n\r\nA workload should only need to validate the `aud` field to know that the transaction token is part of it's trust domain and secondly the `purp` claim to evaluate if the stated purpose is something that the workload participates in. Not also, that a workload is not required to process the `purp` claim from an authorization point of view. I can depend on what the request is and risk, etc. \r\n\r\nThe intended authorization model is that the Transaction Token Service acts as a primary PDP when issuing the transaction token and then each workload can run it's own policy (if desired) to further evaluate the validity of the request.",

Also, what if the signature check passed but the audience does not match with the signing keys? Are workloads expected to check and deny then?\r\n\r\nRelated, do we expect workloads to just accept transaction tokens of a single trust domain or do we see use cases where incoming transaction tokens are part of different trust domains than the workload itself?",

Our implementation was a bit more aligned with Token Exchange where the scope is copied (or narrowed down) to the internally used transaction token. So most deployments rely on having the scope in the \"scope\" claim. There is also pretty good library support for the scope claim already.\r\n\r\nThat said, it might not be an issue of semantics, but rather of ownership. At least in our implementation, scope values are defined (and owned) by the services which enforce the scope (also in internal calls using transaction tokens) when the internal microservice interface is called. Purpose, on the other hand, is more bound to the use case which needs to be fulfilled and the definition of those use cases will rather be done by the external endpoints (BFFs) and thus also owned by them. The internal microservices will then need to be configured to support purposes defined by several external endpoints. So it might still be worth, having the microservice check the scope it defined to be present when calling its API on top of validating the purpose.",

Risks with logging is that token is still valid for few minutes and if logs are rotated to any other central archival storage with access to broader set of people or someone has access to the server with logs, then they can reuse the token. So why not just say MUST not log token?\r\n2. Also how would a service know if incoming token has PII or not. They will have to validate the token, extract claims and then somehow know infer that a claim is PII or not. \r\n3. On similar lines, for PII , can we mention that TTS SHOULD evaluate encrypting  or tokenizing PII claims rather than adding them in plaintext. Adding in plaintext is a risk because TTS isn't aware where the token flows. ",

I understand the concern that the use case for transaction tokens are for a single operation only, and as such long lifetimes does not make sense and will only increase the security risk. However the lifetime of the access token is commonly understood to specify when the operation can be started (though as far as I can tell, RFC6749 actually doesn't say much on this). Many applications however have operations exposed through APIs that take several seconds or even minutes to complete. The client can not be expected to always know how long an operation will take to complete, and can only be reasonably sure that the access token it's presenting when invoking the operation is valid. For operations where multiple internal services are involved, where some services uses Replacement Txn-Token flow as described in section 2.5.2 of the draft, the result may also be that some internal services succeed in requesting transaction tokens, while later steps fail because the original access token is now expired.\n\nI think text in section 9.1 addresses this well, but I would suggest that 2.3 does not bind the transaction token lifetime to the access token lifetime at all, and omit the second sentence in that section completely.",

The context of a txn_token `req_wl` will make it clear that the `req_ip` is the client (iff `req_wl` is a single element), or the calling workload (iff `req_wl` is > 1 element).\n2. Can we add an imperative that the ```req_ip``` for the first txn_token SHOULD NOT be the IP of a proxy or gateway, _e.g._ by using the `X-Forwarded-For` header?\n\nIf the authors think these additions are valuable, I can write the PR.\n\n",

In 5.2.3.1 there is an example that includes the context as `urn:ietd:rfc:6749`, indicating authn via OAuth.  (I'd call this authZ...) \n\nShould this be defined more concretely?  I am concerned that this is pretty open ended and may not accurately represent the authentication in use.  For example, I can see a use case where the workload needs to know that the user has used a phishing resistant authenticator to authenticate and the client has authorized access using OAuth.  In this case would the context be `urn:ietd:rfc:6749` or `prMFA` or something else entirely?  \n\nThere's an argument to be made that this may not make any difference since the tokens are all used within a single trust domain which could define whatever strings they way for the `authn` parameter.

But there is guidance around how Tx Token can get this information. Often it will require to connect some service.

Also Tx token needs a clear contract between TxToken->Context Provider so that its clear what TxToken can pass to Context Provider and what it will expect in return.\n\nOn that we also have to think failure modes.

I think\nit's solving an important problem and largely I like what I'm seeing in the\ndraft. However, I think that the way that scope and purpose are\ndifferentiated can be improved to make the specification easier to\nunderstand, easier to implement, and improve interoperability.\n\nThe way that the purpose is described and contrasted with OAuth scopes in\nsection 5.2.1 makes good sense to me.\n\nThe purp claim captures the exact purpose of this particular transaction.\n> This is often much narrower than a scope value issued to an external\n> client. This is due to the fact that in most cases, the authorization model\n> within the Trust Domain is quite different than the authorization model\n> used with clients external to the Trust Domain. To that end, it is\n> intentional to separate the concept of scope (often fairly coarse-grained)\n> used with external clients from the purpose of the transaction used within\n> the Trust Domain. How a given deployment represents the authorization model\n> within the Trust Domain is out of scope for this specification.\n\n\nBut in the txn-token request (Section 7.1), the purpose of the transaction\ntoken is sent as the scope parameter. I think that has the potential to be\nconfusing, because the two concepts are meant to be distinct. In my\nexperience, non-identity experts often struggle with the existing concepts\nof scopes, claims, and roles. Reusing the scope parameter with purpose\nsemantics is likely going to be a cause for confusion.\n\nSection 9.6 muddies the distinction between scope and purpose further:\n\nThe TTS MUST ensure that the requested purpose (scope) of the Txn-Token is\n> equal or less than the scope(s) identified in the subject_token. This is\n> also true of requesting a replacement Txn-Token. The TTS MUST ensure there\n> is no unintentional increase in authorization scope.\n\n\nIt's not clear to me what the equal to or less than language exactly means,\nbut it's certainly very suggestive, perhaps in a way that isn't good. To\nme, it makes it sound like a purpose is a part of a scope, or that there's\na relationship where certain scopes authorize certain purposes. It seems to\nme that while the decision to issue a transaction token should take the\nscope of the subject token into account, it potentially would also care\nabout other claims of the subject token, the calling client, the request\ncontext, the request details, or the txn token service's policy.\n\nMy suggestions are to\n1. Invent a new \"purpose\" parameter used to request transaction tokens so\nthat tx-token requests do not re-use scope or set it all,\n2. Clarify the intentions of the \"equal or less than\" language in section\n9.6, and\n3. Consider language explicitly stating that transaction tokens MUST NOT\ncontain a scope claim.\n\nThe token exchange spec says that scope is optional, so I would simply\nmandate that in a transaction token exchange, scope is not used.\n\nThinking about how I or others would likely implement this, it seems likely\nthat validating the purpose parameter as well as the configuration and\npolicy related to it would be a separate system from scope processing in\nthe AS. So, from an implementation point of view, adding the new parameter\nwould probably simplify the implementation at the AS. The new semantics and\nparameters that are associated with the transaction token call would mean\nthat the client/initiating workload would already have to write some new\ncode. While existing libraries exist that know how to do token exchange in\ngeneral, the specifics of transaction tokens are still going to require\nsome implementation work. A new purpose parameter wouldn't add\nsignificantly to that.\n\nLanguage to ban scopes from transaction tokens would simply be there to\nre-inforce what the specification is already (not) doing. It helps with\ninteroperability to make sure that the TTS never does include a scope, in\ncase a tx-token was ever misused. Of course we have the typ header to\ndifferentiate the tokens, but leaving the scope out helps prevent their\nmisuse by older JWT libraries that don't know to validate the typ. And in\nany case, it seems that not including the scope is the intention in this\ndraft.\n\n\nCheers,\nJoe DeCock",

To use a different parameter would require the profile to explicitly prohibit the use of the `scope` parameter in favor of a new parameter. I understand how this can be confusing. Unfortunately, the other side is that if we keep adding new parameters and prohibit existing ones, it begs the question of whether we should be profiling RFC 8693 at all and rather defining yet another endpoint.

Ultimately this isn't core to my argument. But my point is that when you're handling a purpose scope, that's a totally separate part of the code with probably a different configuration model to represent purpose. From an implementation point of view, these are separate concepts and separating them at the parameter level would result (at least in my hypothetical implementation) in slightly cleaner code. \n",

Can we change the language to  - claim can be array ? can we leave it to implementation owners?\n\nThere are a few reasons why I want to be careful in adding all req_wls involved - \n\n1. Size - Tx Tokens are going to flow through HTTP headers. In my company, we are careful about size of the token as it flows through HTTP headers. Some web servers block 4KB or more headers and this could be problematic in propagation. If we keep adding all workload identities, then its size will increase. (unpredictable depending on call chain depth)\n2. Token context governance - In general, its useful to only add information that could be useful for making authorization decisions, deep down the call graph. In reality, the services deep down call graph are not aware of all services in call path, so they can't really use write access policies using the req_wls anyways as it depends on what call path was taken to reach that service. Also Hyrum's law, that the more you add, the more ways, people will find to make it use of the data in different ways which may not be right.\n3. I'd recommend to keep only latest information i.e last req_wl identity and let Token issuer log the exchange details against token identifier in its log to later audit all services where replacement happened.\n\nAlso created another issue to cover about having new token id every time there is replacement token generated. https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-transaction-tokens/issues/183",

      "body": "### Problem Statement\n\nAuthorization systems based on zero trust principles must rethink their approach when dealing with AI agents, as the characteristics that differentiate AI agents from traditional web services have major security implications. Unlike static web services, AI agents can act autonomously, adapt their behavior, and access or integrate with new data sources dynamically\u2014sometimes making decisions outside of their originally intended scope. This means that existing zero trust models, which tightly define permissions, verification processes, and access scopes for regular web services, may fall short when applied to adaptive, context-aware AI agents. For true zero trust security, authorization systems should treat each AI agent interaction as potentially unique, inspect agent requests with greater granularity, and continuously evaluate both intent and context\u2014not just identity. Dynamic policy enforcement, ongoing behavioral analysis, and robust audit mechanisms become critical to ensure that AI agents do not inadvertently gain unauthorized access or act outside governance boundaries, despite using the same foundational security model as for traditional web services.\n\nTransaction Tokens are a solution to propagate security context across the call graph in the form of cryptographically signed tokens. These tokens start at the front of the call chain and are propagated through all services in the call chain. Services can leverage the security context for access control and auditing. \n\nTo support AI agent applications in the service graph, Transaction Tokens need to address several challenges: where and how tokens will be generated, how context inputs are captured from agents, scoping/limiting the contexts for agents, ensuring token propagation, and updating the auditing process to capture agent identity along with original actor details.\nAgents by default must be given zero permissions and must be able to get permissions only when delegated by human user. Unsupervised with no human in loop agents could get permissions based on the task but sensitive operations should have human in loop to approve. \n\nAgents could be in different environments including developer\u2019s machine (unsafe environment) or hosted in CloudAuth with protected access.\n\n\n### Assumptions\n \nBefore jumping into solution, an assumption is being made here that OAuth will be used for agentic interactions. Agents will have no permissions of their own but will request permissions from Authorization Server (AS) with human in the loop consenting it. Agents will basically have access token that calls the human user as subject and agent as \u2018actor; representing that agent is acting on behalf of the user.\n\nFor multi-agent, another assumption is that each agent will do OAuth Token Exchange RFC 8693 for getting access token which indicates that the agent is acting on behalf of the previous agent. These access tokens will contain delegation chain information about all agent identities.\n\n### Why not initiate Transaction tokens at the agents ?  \n\nThe obvious solution to ensure Transaction token coverage across entire call chain starting from agent is to initiate Transaction token at beginning of call chain, in this case, it will be the Agentic application. The agentic application will have OAuth access token to access a resource server, but before calling resource server (or workload), it will request Transaction token using the access token. Transaction Token Issuer (TTI) will issue Tx token by validating the input access token. The input access token will have information about agent and human identity. It will also prove that agent is acting on behalf of human. \n\nChallenges with initiating token at agents : \nThere are multiple challenges in this approach. The agent to agent or agent to MCP server interaction can be long running and Transaction tokens will expire. So we have to figure out mechanism to keep Tx token refrehsed. Token propagation is another challenge over MCP/A2A and other protocols. The agents could be running in browser or relatively low secure environments such as a human user\u2019s laptop which increases the risk of exposing our bearer Transaction token.\n\n\n### Proposal: Initiate transaction tokens once agentic interaction is over. \n\nThe core idea of shifting token generation away from potentially unsafe environments and onto a trusted server is compelling. Core design principle - The proposal simplifies agent logic by shifting complexity to the trusted, centralized infrastructure\u2014the Authorization Server and the Transaction Token Issuer. \n\nLet's take this flow as an example - \n\n```\nHuman -> Agent A \u2192 MCP Server \u2192 Resource server \u2192 Internal Service (Resource Server)\n```\n\n- Human will invoke Agent. \n- Agent will take action by calling MCP Server. \n- MCP Server throws OAuth challenge 401 unauthorized. \n- Agent which is already registered with OAuth Authorization Server (AS) will request access token. \n- AS will invoke authorization code flow and ask human for consent. \n- Human approves it and then standard auth code flow starts. At the end, agent has access token that says agent is allowed to take action on behalf of subject (human). \n- MCP Server gets the access token. \n- MCP server has to call internal service now. MCP Server gets access token from agent, and then invoke OAuth Token Exchange RFC 8693 with AS and gets another access token. \n- AS verifies permissions of MCP server, access tokens and then issues access token to MCP Server. \n- This access token contains delegation chain including (human, agent, MCP Server). \n- \n- MCP Server now has access token with all delegation chain and about to call internal service. \n- This is where it should initiate Tx token by calling  Transaction Token Issuer (TTI) and passing the access token. \n- TTI will have all the necessary information to add in the Tx token using the access token as the access token has call chain information. \n- TTI must validate the access token before trusting it for generating Transaction token.\n- The generated Transaction token will have the human identity as the Subject, the first agent identity as 'act' claim. It also aligns with https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/214 \n\n\nAs supervised agents act on behalf of humans, its important to include their identity in the Transaction tokens. Whenever human triggers an agent, sub MUST contain human identity and there should be a new claim in the token to include identity of the agent that acts on behalf of the human user.\n\n\n```\nact: : OPTIONAL The \"act\" (actor) claim, within the context of OAuth 2.0 token exchange and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), is defined in RFC 8693: OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange. The value will be the agent that is acting on behalf of the human user. In case the access token contains delegation chain, then it will be the first actor in 'act' field where this on behalf of flow started.\n```\n\n### Detailed explanation of the proposal\nThe core idea is that Transaction Tokens will leverage the OAuth Authorization Server-issued access tokens as proof to issue a Transaction Token. These access tokens will be issued to AI agent applications and MCP servers in the call chain. For agent-to-agent or agent-to-MCP server interactions, access tokens from agents all the way to the last MCP server/agent will carry delegation chain information. This means all identities involved up to that point will be present in these access tokens. This differs from the current service access token model where an access token from Service A to Service B is different from an access token issued by Service B to call Service C. \n\nThe advantage of this approach is that now Tx tokens aren\u2019t exposed to unsafe environments in which agents are running. If agents do have long running interactions, they will still maintain access tokens because most of the agents are supposed to be OAuth compliant. This gives Tx token RFC to be popular and get widely adopted but still not blocked on agents support Tx token. \n).\n\nFor mid-call chain use cases, \n```\nWorkload A(w/ Tx token) \u2192 MCP Server A \u2192 MCP Server B \u2192 Workload-2\n```\nwhere Transaction Token propagation through the service graph starts but agent-to-agent interaction begins, the first MCP server or agent  (MCP Server A in above example) will perform an OAuth token exchange to get onBehalfOf permissions, and the Transaction Token context could be preserved in the access token as a claim. So between MCP Server A \u2192 MCP Server B, access token is flowing but this access token was requested by MCP Server A as part of OAuth token exchange. In OAuth token exchange, MCP Server should send access token and Tx token as well to ensure access token captures the Tx token contents as claim. Before calling Workload-2, the access token can be used to get a Transaction Token at MCP Server B. TTI this time, instead of generating a token with new contexts, the preserved contexts from access token claim will be used. \n\nIn summary, access tokens will be leveraged to procure Transaction Tokens. The OAuth token exchanged access tokens contain a delegation chain of identities, and when agent interaction starts in the middle of the call chain, access tokens will preserve Transaction Token contexts to get Transaction Tokens back when service interaction begins.\n\nThis approach for Transaction Tokens depends on OAuth Authorization Server support for OAuth token exchange, registering AI applications in the OAuth Authorization Server for identities, and delegation and permission models. The approach simplifies overall Transaction Token integration in this AI agent-based service graph as Transaction Tokens don't need to implement propagation over various protocols, or worry about issuing bearer tokens in unsafe environments such as developers' machines or browsers.\n\nThe agent-side space is rapidly evolving, and by moving Transaction Token generation to the server side, integration stays simple while the OAuth Authorization Server handles the complexity. This approach assumes that all relevant protocols are or will be supporting OAuth, including agent applications. This means that agent application frameworks that support OAuth should be sufficient for AI agent apps to start development and launch, instead of integrating Transaction Tokens explicitly in their agent code and further complicating it.\n\n### Security and additional considerations\n\n- I acknowledge that while the risk of exposing a Transaction Token is removed, the risk of a compromised OAuth Access Token remains. Advocate for mTLS as a non-negotiable security measure for all inter-service communication to protect against this.\n\n- We should consider may be new, standardized claim to the oauth-transaction-tokens working group for transporting Transaction Token context within an access token. This ensures interoperability and prevents proprietary implementations.\n\n- We must mandate that all audit trails for AI agent interactions include the full delegation chain (human, agent), along with all dynamic business context used to make a decision.\n\n- \n\n",

OAuth access token scopes are permissions granted to an OAuth client in order to access resources (after receiving consent from the user in most cases). This is different from the `purp` of a Transaction Token, which specifies permissions for the specific transaction. It does not include user consent, and it is decoupled from what the OAuth client may have access to as a result of the `scope` in the incoming OAuth access token (if one is present).\n2. Using the same term `scope` for two different domains as described above can cause confusion among users who often have to deal with both systems - those that use/issue OAuth access tokens, and those that use/issue Transaction Tokens\n3. The `purp` claim is expected to contain finer grained permissions than a `scope` in an OAuth access token. This is because a specific set of permissions may be approved (automatically by relevant policy components) for the short duration of that Transaction Token, and such approval is codified in the `purp`, whereas the `scope` in a long-lived OAuth access token may represent all possible permissions a user may require over the lifetime of that access token.\n",

I do not, however, think that trying to invent a new claim like this improves the situation. Rather, I believe that it'd exacerbate confusion. No doubt others might draw different conclusions, but I read #178 as evidence of confusion compounding. https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-transaction-tokens/issues/194#issuecomment-3258927820 also reads that way to me.",

Brian's points about authorization deployment models being as individual as the deployment (I hope I'm not putting words in your mouth @bc-pi ) makes a ton of sense. While having a much finer grained internal authorization model may be better from a security model, it doesn't mean that is commonly deployed. Transaction tokens should work for all authorization deployment models.\n2. I envisioned the transaction context to be more about making parameters of the requests immutable. This could include RAR details and we do call that out. But maybe there is not enough practice to codify \"best practice\" is a way that would make it possible for tooling to be built. My thinking is that if each transaction token service constructs its own form of a transaction token, then special code is needed to process those tokens and moving to a new transaction token service product likely means a lot of change within the infrastructure. Do we think there is a way we can make it easier for tooling to be built for processing transaction tokens?\n\nAt the moment, I'm leaning toward leaving the separate claim in the transaction token but calling it `scope` instead of `purp` and adding text to clarify that the value of the transaction token `scope` claim is up to the transaction token service and does not need to make the scope requested nor the scope value in the access_token if supplied.\n\nFurther removing the `scope` claim from the transaction token can happen in a future PR if the WG believes the `tcxt` claim is sufficient.",

Resource servers may only require one particular scope-token to be present while ignoring all the others.\n\nI understand that the purpose of the Txn-Token is rather unique. It defines the specific operation to be performed. Yet, the transaction token draft also defines this value as a list of space-separated strings. My current understanding is that those strings are actually related and that the order is important contrary to how scope for Access Tokens works. I think the purpose value should not be seen as a list of strings, but rather seen in its entirety as a unique value defining the overall operation being performed.

The purpose value \"send-mail\" is being requested.

          "body": "The following is an analysis provided by Claude:\n\n# **Analysis of Transaction Tokens Editor's Draft and WIMSE Architecture Terminology Alignment**\n\nBased on my review of the editor's draft of Transaction Tokens and the WIMSE Architecture document (draft-ietf-wimse-arch-06), here's my analysis of terminology alignment and recommendations:\n\n## **Key Terminology Comparison**\n\n### **1\\. Workload**\n\n* **Transaction Tokens (editor's draft)**: \"An independent computational unit that can autonomously receive and process invocations, and can generate invocations of other workloads\"  \n* **WIMSE Architecture**: \"A workload is a running instance of software executing for a specific purpose\"  \n* **Analysis**: These definitions are compatible but serve different emphasis. Transaction Tokens focuses on the invocation aspect while WIMSE is more general. The definitions can coexist.\n\n### **2\\. Trust Domain**\n\n* **Transaction Tokens**: \"A collection of systems, applications, or workloads that share a common security policy\"  \n* **WIMSE Architecture**: \"A logical grouping of systems that share a common set of security controls and policies\"  \n* **Analysis**: Nearly identical \\- both emphasize shared security policies. Well-aligned.\n\n### **3\\. Security Context**\n\n* **Transaction Tokens**: No longer has a formal \"Authorization Context\" definition (removed per changelog)  \n* **WIMSE Architecture**: Defines \"Security Context\" broadly  \n* **Analysis**: Good alignment \\- Transaction Tokens removed the conflicting definition and now uses context within specific claims (`tctx`, `rctx`)\n\n### **4\\. Call Chain**\n\n* Both specs use this term consistently, with Transaction Tokens owning the formal definition  \n* **Analysis**: No conflict\n\n### **5\\. External Endpoint**\n\n* Transaction Tokens provides the formal definition  \n* WIMSE uses it without defining it  \n* **Analysis**: Good complementarity\n\n## **Notable Improvements in Editor's Draft**\n\nThe editor's draft has already made several improvements that help alignment:\n\n1. **Removed \"Authorization Context\" definition** \\- eliminating potential confusion with WIMSE's \"Security Context\"  \n2. **Changed \"purpose\" to \"scope\"** \\- aligning better with OAuth terminology  \n3. **Added reference to WIMSE workload authentication** (\\[I-D.ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol\\])\n\n## **Recommended Changes to Transaction Tokens Draft**\n\n### **1\\. Add WIMSE Architecture Reference**\n\nAdd \\[I-D.ietf-wimse-arch\\] as an informative reference and include a note in the introduction or overview explaining the relationship:\n\ntext\n\n```\n\"Transaction Tokens implement patterns described in the WIMSE Architecture \n[I-D.ietf-wimse-arch] for propagating user identity and authorization \ncontext across workloads within a trust domain.\"\n```\n\n### **2\\. Consider Harmonizing Workload Definition**\n\nEither:\n\n* Keep both definitions but add a note explaining the relationship, OR  \n* Adopt WIMSE's simpler definition and add transaction-specific details\n\nSuggested addition to terminology:\n\ntext\n\n```\nWorkload:\n    A running instance of software executing for a specific purpose \n    [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch]. In the context of Transaction Tokens, \n    workloads are computational units that can autonomously receive \n    and process invocations, and can generate invocations of other \n    workloads.\n```\n\n### **3\\. Clarify Security Context Relationship**\n\nAdd a note explaining that the `tctx` and `rctx` claims represent specific implementations of the broader \"Security Context\" concept from WIMSE:\n\ntext\n\n```\nNote: The transaction context (tctx) and requester context (rctx) \nclaims in Transaction Tokens are specific representations of the \nbroader Security Context concept defined in [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].\n```\n\n### **4\\. Reference WIMSE Authentication Methods**\n\nThe draft already references \\[I-D.ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol\\] in Section 7.5, which is good. Consider also mentioning WIT (Workload Identity Token) when discussing authentication options.\n\n## **Assessment of Issue \\#213**\n\n**Yes, Issue \\#213 should be acted upon**, but the required changes are relatively minor:\n\n### **Why Action is Needed:**\n\n1. **Architectural Context**: Transaction Tokens is essentially a profile/implementation of WIMSE patterns \\- making this explicit improves understanding  \n2. **Ecosystem Coherence**: As part of the broader WIMSE ecosystem, aligned terminology reduces confusion  \n3. **Already Partially Addressed**: The editor's draft has already made good progress (removing Authorization Context, adding WIMSE references)\n\n### **Priority Actions:**\n\n1. **Add WIMSE Architecture as informative reference** \u2713 (High Priority)  \n2. **Add brief section explaining relationship to WIMSE** \u2713 (High Priority)  \n3. **Consider harmonizing workload definition** \u25cb (Medium Priority)  \n4. **Add notes connecting concepts** \u25cb (Low Priority)\n\n### **What's Already Good:**\n\n* Trust Domain definitions are well-aligned  \n* The removal of \"Authorization Context\" eliminates a major conflict  \n* References to WIMSE authentication specs are already present  \n* The specs complement each other well with Transaction Tokens providing specific implementation details\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe editor's draft has already made significant improvements toward alignment. The remaining work is primarily about making the architectural relationship explicit and ensuring readers understand how Transaction Tokens fits within the broader WIMSE framework. These changes would improve clarity without requiring major restructuring of the document.\n\nRetry\n\nTo run code, enable code execution and file creation in Settings \\> Capabilities.\n\n[Claude can make mistakes.](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8525154-claude-is-providing-incorrect-or-misleading-responses-what-s-going-on)  \n[Please double-check responses.](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8525154-claude-is-providing-incorrect-or-misleading-responses-what-s-going-on)  ",

Sometimes a transaction may take longer than expected.  IF the token lifetime can be refreshed beyond the original time then the transaction can succeed.  THis also seems better than trying to issue tokens with lifetimes that are longer than necessary for most transactions.  In this case the IAT claim could still reflect the original token issue time so the token service can enforce a strict lifetime. \n",

Also the threats that apply to higher lifetime at original token are applicable to a service in middle of call chain requesting higher lifetime. I believe the TxToken always must issue token with fixed TTL. Keep things simple at Tx Token. It can be configurable on Tx Token where certain allowlisted approved services are able to get higher TTL but then its up to the implementation of Tx token where it wants to maintain a mapping of ServiceName->TTL.

The Transaction Token Service is still authoritative for whether a replacement transaction token may even be issued.

I'm not sure we can control this within the spec.

The transaction token service assigns its own identifier as a \"sub\" claim. The sub claim and the req_wl claim may be the same (and things are easier when they are from a forensic/chaining tracing perspective), but pragmatically, it seems reasonable to leave \"sub\" assignment to the transaction token service.\n\nWe can add text to clarify this, but first want to confirm the mental model.",

It is an interesting question about whether it should be a MUST if we decide to move away from a \"purp\" claim (@gffletch and @tulshi - something to keep in mind).\n\nRegarding the capabilities of the transaction server, it depends on the implementation and the overall architecture. As an initial transaction token, the tctx information may simply come from parameters passed. The decision about whether to honour those paramaters may be done further down the call chain (e.g. a risk management service may evaluate the transaction volume). Another service may check the amount against the funds available and another may do compliance checks against the users account. Some of these checks may be done by the transaction token service itself. It depends on the deployment an implementation. The main thing here is to ensure that these parameters/information is bound to the transaction and protecting the integrity of the transaction information throughout the call chain.",

Our latest language on authentication is that it is a MUST, sso that information has to be available. However, rctx is an optional claim, and so, any MUST (and arguably the SHOULD as well) is conditional on rctx ebing included. We may want to state that conditionality explicitly. e.g. if we decide it is a MUST, we need langugage like, \"if the rctx claim is included, the workload identifier MUST be included as the req_wl claim).\n\n@tulshi - I think the question you raise is separate from what George raised. I agree with your perspective that request_context is one of the inputs, but should not be the only input to determining rctx content. Enriching that with out-of-band information drawn from some back-end management service seems likely and plausible. If we remove the SHOULD, we may want to add langugage that suggest backend enrichment may be an option.",

To that end, the TTS is responsible to ensuring any issued transaction tokens have all the necessary claims to allow downstream systems to implement the required authorization policy.

For instance there may be cases where some workloads may opt for employing Token Introspection to validate Txn-Tokens instead of doing it locally (which is by the way not mentioned at all in the current draft).",

I'm thinking mostly about the case where an internal workload (e.g. like a scheduled job) needs a TraT and has additional details about the transaction that it wants to make immutable. We can say that it is up to the Transaction Token Service (TTS) to determine what data is included in the TraT. How the TTS makes that determination is out of scope for the specification.",

If we were to somehow hint about the `aud` value in the resulting TraT, that is determined by the TTS, so providing that in the request is inconsequential (and the requester has no control over it). It's possible that the same TTS has multiple trust domains, but there could be other ways for it to distinguish which trust domain it is acting on behalf of, such as a different token exchange endpoint URL.\r\n- Similarly, the `exp` value could be used to indicate the expiration of the request itself, or it could be used as a hint to indicate the lifetime of the resulting TraT. Since we have already noted that a TTS may reject JWTs with an unreasonably old `iat` value, we do not need to specify an `exp` value. If we were to hint about the lifetime of the resulting TraT, I feel the requester would need to know a lot more about the transaction than a typical requester such as a general-purpose API gateway would know. I'd rather that the TTS determine the TraT's `exp` based on its policy and understanding of the actual transaction that is being requested. ",

Given everything that goes on in he world of token theft, having this extra constraint can help minimise the impact of token replay (stealing a token from one workload and replaying against another transaction token endpoint and so forth). Are there scenarios where we think the workload would not know which transaction token service it will be presenting its self-signed credential to?\r\n\r\nI also recall that we had some constraint that a transaction token cannot be valid for longer than the original token. This raises the question on what the guidance is for expiry if the exp claim is not present as in this case.

The `txn` claim in the Txn-token provides a unique identifier that when logged by the TTS and each subsequent workload can provide both discovery and auditability of successful and failed transactions. It is therefore strongly RECOMMENDED to use an identifier, unique within the trust domain, for the `txn` value.\r\n",

This is in order to prevent replay of tokens or leakage of PII or other sensitive information via log files. A hash of the Txn-Token may be logged to allow for correlation with the log files of the Txn-Token Service that records issued tokens. Alternatively the JWS payload of a Txn-Token may be logged after the signature has been removed. If the Txn-Token contains PII, then care should be taken in logging the content of the Txn-Token so that the PII does not get logged.\r\n\r\n",

If it is supposed to be used only once, it would have more similarities with an Authorization Code instead of a Refresh Token (although an Authorization Code is supposed to be short-lived).\r\n\r\nClient/Service authentication is indeed something which needs to be addressed. As this is currently lacking, basically any workload can exchange a Batch Token back to a Txn-Token at any given time with the help of the Txn-Token Service. Essentially, a workload can exchange a Txn-Token to a Batch Token send this Batch Token along to other entities (e.g. Kafka event queues or store in a database) and any other entity having access to that Batch Token (e.g. Kafka event processors) can get an updated Txn-Token based on the Batch Token again. When issuing the Batch Token, do we want to limit the clients which can later exchange the Batch Token back to an Txn-Token or do we trust that the implementers will reasonably protect access to Batch Tokens? In case of limiting access within this spec, we might need to encode the audience(s) which are allowed to exchange the Batch Token later.\r\n\r\nHow long will Batch Tokens be valid? I assume at maximum for how long the keys are available to the Txn-Token Service to decrypt the content of the Batch Token.\r\n",

              "body": "Having thought about this issue further I would say that a batch token would effectively translate to the recipient(s) of the token being put at a higher level of trust. Transaction tokens are intended to relate to a single transaction. If this is long-lived you effectively have a business process initiated by the original (authenticated) request that would have produced the transaction token. The short lifetime ensures that the token is not (ab)used later for accesses that are not related to the initiating action. Long lived tokens do not have this reduction in potential harm because of the short lifespan. Instead batch tokens would require explicit revocation, and even then are much more vulnerable to misuse (often just poor practice rather than malicious intent).\r\n\r\nThere are generally two ways (and the hybrid) in which the tokens can be used:\r\n- One is with an overall process coordinating the long-lived activity. In this case the coordinating service would hold the batch token and create sub-transactions as needed. This coordinating service would hold (one or multiple) transaction tokens and has a high level of trust (it is a primary attack venue due to its central role).\r\n  Kafka could perhaps take this overall coordination, but it would not fit well with its nature as pure event system\r\n- The other is chained invocations where services directly invoke their successors. When this is long lived this is effectively a hidden distributed process (anti-pattern), and a batch transaction token in such context creates a variety of heightened risks.",

Sometimes restating things is worthwhile but I don't think that's the case here.\r\nThe second sentence with \"the actor_token MUST authenticate the identity of the requesting workload\" seems overly restrictive. What if the authentication has happened via other means and the actor_token is there to convey some other notion of delegation or something?\r\nThere's a lot more to \"Client Authentication\", the section name, than these two sentences. Consider something different.

If the token or other credential (e.g. self-signed JWT)  presented to the Txn-Token service when requesting a Txn-Token has an expiration time, then the Txn-Token Service MUST NOT issue a Txn-Token if the expiration time has passed. The lifetime of the Txn-Token itself MAY exceed the expiration time of the presented token. The expectation is that since Txn-Tokens are short lived and are authorizing a specific transaction, extending beyond the lifetime of the presented expiration time is not a security risk. If a long-running process such as a batch or offline task is involved, the mechanism used to perform the external or internal invocation still results in a short-lived Txn-Token.\r\n```",

I think it's helpful because the default from an OpenID perspective is that `sub` is only guaranteed to be unique within the context of the `iss` claim. If developers bring this perspective to the implementation it may cause issues. I suppose that statement could be moved to a \"security considerations\" section instead of inline. However, that line is not new to the definition. It is currently in draft-04 and to my knowledge there wasn't a comment to remove it.",
