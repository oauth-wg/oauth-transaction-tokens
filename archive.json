This is not unlike the problems we see with wallets and the need for some way to let clients authenticate without being pre-registered. \r\n\r\nI wonder if we can remove this requirement and instead rely on some form of authentication where the trust is in the credential issuer. For example, with SPIFFE, there is an authority that issues the credential to the workload, so as long as the client presents a credential issued by the authority, it could be trusted (provided the authority is trusted).

If all services operate within the same trust boundary, they already know their trusted authorization server and an iss claim would just add clutter and unnecessary data to the token. Also it would mean that one had to already trust some data within the transaction token before being able to validate its signature. This could lead to a rogue component to send requests to an internal service with carefully crafted transaction tokens with an iss pointing to another server the rogue component has control over. To prevent injecting rogue iss, the internal service would need to validate the provided iss value with a preconfigured list of allowed ones.\r\n\r\nIn our environment (trust boundary) where we are using internal tokens for transactions, the internal services have the authorization server's host name configured. Internal services can decide to pull (and cache) the jwks from the well-known url and validate the tokens locally or they can use the token introspection endpoint of the authorization server for validating the token. Validating the internal/transaction tokens with token introspection is useful for some sensitive operations and has the benefit that this validation can fail if for instance the access token the transaction token was derived from got revoked or the authentication context associated with the tokens got flagged.\r\n",

Those formats could not be verified (e.g. signature check) by the workloads locally, but would require incorporating Token Introspection to get the data. For performance reasons, the format should at least be defined as self contained and verifiable locally. CWT as well as (SD-)JWT would have these properties. In the IETF meeting protobuf was mentioned. As far as I know, protobuf does not have this property, so I don't see it as a fitting candidate.\r\n\r\nWe also need to consider interoperability. If the spec allowed for multiple formats (or even leaves the format out of the specification), generic libraries/frameworks to implement the protocol would need to support not just one but a lot of formats or even make the format (serialization/deserialization) pluggable. Although this might be a good idea anyway, it tends to be more complex.\r\n\r\nIn regards to selective disclosure: The purpose of the transaction token is to pass it along the transaction call chain. So if there is specific data of the original presented Access Token not to be disclosed in the transaction token, the TTS would simply not add it in the transaction token when issuing it. Although a workload can choose to exchange the transaction token for another one, the purpose was to narrow the scope to further limit the access which the new transaction token could be used for. At this point the new transaction token could contain even less information than the original transaction token. I don't think that there should be more information disclosed at this point. That's why I don't think that SD-JWTs would have an application here.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I do see an application for a transaction token which contains specific information for specific workloads along the call chain. I can see some similarities to Rich Authorization Requests (RAR) where there can be PII/resource identifiers in the transaction token which should only be visible to some workloads even if the transaction token is passed along through all participating workloads.\r\n",

The benefits will be unified token issuance and verification process for both external- and internal-initiated transactions. The only alternative in the OAuth world I could think of is the Client Credentials Grant, but it doesn't specify how to push transaction-specific data. Also, the result will be an Access Token and not a Txn-Token, which assumes that downstream workloads must be able to understand both.\r\n\r\nMaybe slightly unrelated, but it is also a bit unclear how should we communicate the desired `azd` and `purp` to the Txn-Token Service?

In other words, we wouldn't want the logging service to be able to request a transaction service for the purpose of transferring crypto from a user's account.\r\n\r\nI would argue that there is still a `req_ctx` in this case, it may just contain different claims.

As it has been established that requesting Txn-Tokens without an external trigger is needed. however, the current spec requires an Access token to be presented in the subject_token parameter and the question is, how an internal batch process would obtain this. @dteguin (and me in the related issue #62) mentioned Client credentials grant for obtaining the AT. However, client credentials grant based ATs may not be related to users referred to with the sub claim, so it may be a challenge to issue Txn-Tokens with a user-related sub when the client credentials grant based AT does not contain one.\r\n\r\nIn #62 I gave an example where a batch processor might be able to present an expired Txn-Token, but there are still scenarios where no AT can be presented in the subject_token parameter or where the presented subject_token does not contain the information necessary to fill and issue the Txn-Token. This information needs to be provided somehow to the TTS. If this information must be part of the subject_token or somehow be obtainable by the TTS via parts of the subject_token content, it should at least be mentioned in the spec.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd like to see an option where the TTS can be called without a subject_token as input and instead providing the necessary information via additional parameters (e.g. sub within the req_ctx). It goes without saying, that this type of Token issuance should only be allowed to a very limited set of authenticated clients which have a special trust relationship with the TTS.",

It then obtains short-lived Txn-Tokens that may be used to authorize the call to downstream services in the call-chain.\"\r\n\r\nI assume the reasoning behind this is that there would be no need to define a Txn-Token Request without an original Access Token. However, I think that creating long-living Access Tokens just for the purpose of exchanging them for short-lived Txn-Tokens and then throwing them away can be considered wasteful (energy costs). Every internally originating job would need at least two calls instead of just one to obtain the Txn-Token.\r\n\r\nKeeping those long-living Access Tokens around to re-use them for longer time is usually not useful for batch processes as those processes operate on a lot of user accounts in quick succession. Maintaining all those Access Tokens in memory is often not feasible. Neither is a storage system. I also think that using long-living Access Tokens in this scenario can add security risks. Those Access Tokens could leak and another party could use them to create Txn-Tokens or access resources the Access Token was meant for.\r\n\r\nIn our own implementation of a Txn-Service, the Txn-Service (Token Exchange) is also providing the Token endpoint and allows specific internal clients to use the Client Credentials Grant Type (mTLS client certificates) to obtain Txn-Tokens right away. The necessary input parameters are essentially a combination of the Token Request based on Client Credentials Grant and Token Exchange with a Txn-Token profile.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to extend the Txn-Token Service interface to allow Txn-Token Requests without the Access Token as input? This would essentially mean to define a Txn-Token profile for the Token endpoint in addition to the Token Exchange protocol.",

Think about a use case where email is being delivered to a mail box. SMTP does not carry the access token that authorized the sending of the email. In that context, the in-bound email server needs to be able to request a Txn-Token for the purpose of delivering the email to the specified inbox.\r\n2. The general intent for keeping Txn-Tokens very short lived is to remove the need for revocation. Revocation is difficult for any token system (see the issuer-holder-verifier efforts in this space). Given that the vast majority of transactions complete in a very short timeframe, keeping the life-time of the Txn-Token short makes a lot of sense.\r\n3. There are some edge cases where a longer lived Txn-Token may be beneficial or required.  Say for instance a user asks for their account to be deleted (GDPR) and the Txn-Token needs to live for multiple days? even though the underlying identity system may have cleaned up the user identifier data. That said, these edge cases should be vetted very carefully as there is a security risk if a Txn-Token lives for a long time and hence can be replayed potentially in compromising ways.",

For incoming mails we have a mail delivery agent which wants to use the mail storage system service to store the mail in the user mailbox. In order to write to the mailbox of a user, the delivery agent needs a Txn-Token with the sub of the user. The delivery agent asks the TTS about a Txn-Token and presents its client credentials and the mail address of the recipient/user. The TTS allows issuing Txn-Tokens to the delivery agent. There is no long-living access token involved. The issued Txn-Token is short lived (1 minute in our deployments).\r\n\r\n3. Whenever a user cancels their contract, we have to keep the data for some time (number of days depending on type of data, legal restrictions, etc.) after the delete operations are performed. The delayed delete operation is done by batch processes. Now, instead of creating and storing long-living access tokens which could be leaked and abused elsewhere, we decided to retain the short-lived Txn-Tokens and allow only those batch processes to ask the TTS to issue new Txn-Tokens for already expired Txn-Tokens to perform the actual delete operation which requires a valid and not expired Txn-Token when calling the storage system services.\r\n\r\nSo my argument is against using (and potentially abusing) long-living access tokens, and instead for allowing expired Txn-Tokens to be presented to the TTS to re-issue Txn-Tokens for the purpose of finalizing a delayed operation.",

My point was to only allow specific authenticated clients the exchange of expired TraTs. It is true that if those clients get hacked themselves (and the client authentication can be done by an attacker) new TraTs can be created and abused.\r\n\r\nHowever, longer living TraTs have also the risk of being abused with replay attacks. I think the risk for replay attacks with longer living TraTs is even higher as an attacker would just need to get hold of the long-living TraTs and does not have the need to renew it.\r\n",

Assuming the `purp` claim is narrowly scoped, the TTS should NOT issue a new Txn-Token with a different `purp` value. \n\nI would probably recommend creating very specific `purp` values for this use case and then only allowing specific clients to request a Txn-Token where the `subject_token` value is the expired Txn-Token.

          "body": "Indeed, the spec does not say anything about whether and how the TTS is validating the txn token before issuing a replacement txn-token. So presenting an already expired txn-token can be accepted based on the authenticated client, purpose and scope. After all, it can be a specifically defined policy.\r\n\r\nI recommend that we at least acknowledge this case in the spec and give guidance when to use it. As we also have the case of not presenting any token when requesting a txn-token (see #53), I think that as long as a workload is in possession of a txn-token - even if it is expired - we should recommend to present it when requesting replacement txn-tokens. It should be the decision of the TTS whether to accept the expired txn-token and not of the workload (the workload could just take the subject from the expired token and present it as the subject_token to the TTS).\r\n\r\nOne additional aspect came to our attention. There are actually two cases for expired txn-tokens:\r\n\r\n1. The exp claim says it is expired, but the signature is still valid\r\n2. The signature is not valid (anymore) as the key used to sign the token is not available anymore\r\n\r\nDepending on how frequently a TTS is rotating its key material, the second case might occur for such long running processes like deleting account data several weeks after the customer has cancelled their contract. For instance our TTS implementation is rotating the keys daily. Only the next, current and previous signing keys are provided to workloads (via JWKS uri). Even if a workload is not able to verify the signature of a txn-token it received several weeks ago, the TTS might still be able to keep the old key material for a longer period so that it can at least validate the signature of those txn-tokens.\r\n",

It contains the trust domain. To my understanding, every trust domain has a single (logical) Txn-Service. A Txn-Service is usually configured to only issue Txn-Tokens to one and only one trust domain. Also the authenticating clients which the Txn-Service accepts in incoming requests are part of that trust domain. After all, they have been registered within that trust domain. It might be possible that the Txn-Service is used in multiple trust domains. In those scenarios I fully agree that the audience parameter is REQUIRED. My guess is, though, that the most deployed setup will incorporate a single trust domain.",

Also, if it is defined as REQUIRED, it will be enforced by 3rd party libraries which a company might want to integrate in their components/services. This essentially forces the company (albeit using Txn-Tokens within their trust domain only internally) to define and set the aud claim without added benefit.\r\n\r\nHaving aud REQUIRED also implies that the value needs to be validated somehow. I think this aspect should be mentioned in the spec, if it is really required. So every Token service must have the audience parameter validated as well as every service/worker receiving a Txn-Token must validate the aud claim against a configured accepted value (or list of values).\r\n",

It has less to do with the AS in that case\r\n- (George) In that context, if my workload needs to initiate 3 different types of transactions by calling 3 different workloads, my service would still go to the TTS to get a TraT for each use case. In the Lambda case, one could provision the Lambda with a pre-injected TraT. A Kubernetes WL would get a workload token at startup, but would need a TraT per request.\r\n- (Justin) Agree that these are two different things. There isn't going to be just one way for this to show up at runtime. This is different from access tokens\r\n- (Pieter) We could have at least one TTS per cluster. Having it called out that it can be standalone, or a part of the AS will be interesting. We should call out the security considerations of standalone, so that we don't redo all the work that AS security considerations already cover\r\n- (Pieter) In WIMSE, a deliverable is local token issuance. There's a model where the TraT is embedded in the workload (the workload is self-issuing)\r\n- (George) One of the reasons to create this issue is to collect these ideas. We could collect these  different ideas, and discuss in Vancouver.

Otherwise the call from B -> C would result in an authn/z error and fail - no need for an replacement token, is it? \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf B can generate dummy tokens, how can it be prevented that it does not generate a dummy token which looks like a legit token and impersonate users like this? E.g. B is compromised and generates dummy tokens to request informations from other workloads that in fact accept dummy tokens? \r\n\r\nMaybe this question is leading to the next one:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHow are dummy tokens distinguished from real ones?

If C is more of an intermediate passthrough type service, then C will rely on D to deny/allow, in which case B has to send a token.\r\n\r\n> How are dummy tokens distinguished from real ones? Is there a risk developers by mistake consider dummy tokens as trusted?\r\n\r\nYes, that is the most important aspect. In general, as Hyrum's law suggests, once token is out there, we won't be able to control who uses it for what purpose. Our recommendation can be that - a token validator (e.g. Service D) MUST always use the claims in token ONLY IF validate signature exists. So that even if Service B signs it, D must deny request saying you (service B) isn't valid Tx Token service. Anyways, even if we don't specify the idea of dummy token here, someone (service B or C), can potentially overwrite the header value with its own Tx token string. \r\n\r\n",

Although we have some workloads which already receive, validate and forward TraTs, they are being called by other workloads which do not present TraTs yet and on the other end, they call other workloads which just ignore the TraTs and don't pass them along yet. So during this rollout phase (which can take months or even years) it is quite common that TraTs are getting lost frequently and no workload can actually enforce TraT validation.\r\n\r\nHowever, we do not think that any workload should be able to create its own dummy TraT just to fill the gap. We think that only the TraT Service should have the authority to issue TraTs even for those cases where gaps need to be filled. This scenario is similar to presenting self-signed tokens to the TraT Service which then issues TraTs to the requestors. The TraT Service decides which client is allowed to present self-signed tokens. While deployment is progressing the number of allowed clients will be reduced over time.",

If you rotate key at time T1 and Tx token services starts to issue tokens with new key at same time, we have to callout that it should do it at T1+X where X is the SLA for ensuring all services that validate signature will receive the new public key to verify signature. Keys can be shared out of band. One idea is to generate two pairs and two corresponding public keys will be available with services all the time. Tx Token service will have two private pairs available. Lets say PrvtKey-1 and PrvtKey-2 are with issuers. PrvtKey-1 should be used from T1 to T1+24hrs and Key-2 from T1+24 to T1+48hrs. When Tx token switches from Key-1 to 2, it doesn't have to worry about some service not having public key for key-2 to validate the token. This way key synchronization is out of band + key rotation happens frequently which keeps key rotation machinery well-tested. Generally there is no need to rotate key every 24hrs so we can choose to relax that but even if we have to force rotate key then we have to make sure force rotated key (i.e new key pair) should be used to mint tokens only when we can guarantee that those tokens can be validated.",

Why not request new token always when batch process or workflow resumes from long pause?  Because sometimes the service might just want to use the claims of its caller (as long as its permitted to do so) rather than new token. \r\n\r\nFor example, if an internal service C is called by A and B, and C is allowed to make requests to D for tax or accounting purpose. \r\nA->C\r\nB->C\r\nC->D\r\nA is allowed to make request and request Tx token for tax purpose.\r\nB is allowed to make request and request Tx token for accounting purpose.\r\nC is allowed for both accounting and tax purpose because is a common service\r\n\r\n\r\nNow,  C simply wants to use usage claim based on who called - A or B. C can do so by passing token generated for A or B to D. But if C is a workflow that pauses for more than TTL of Tx token, then token expires and it loses all the context about claims associated with A and B. In such case, before going on long pause, C can request refresh token from Tx Token service by passing original valid token it receives. It requests this token before going into long pause. It receives refresh token which it will use when it resumes. Refresh token will have longer TTL. Tx Token can configure TTL per use case and/or per caller (e.g. C). Tx token service will include claims in the input valid token in the refresh token but the refresh token cannot be used to access data from any service. Services should ignore refresh tokens in case someone (C) tries to use it directly. C has to make an exchange and pass refresh token to TxToken issuer service to get new token to pass to D. ",

Its' valid only in Tx token service. We can encrypt it or but won't signature just suffice?\r\n\r\n@gffletch About your comment - \"I think this 'batch token' should also be sender constrained in some way.\"\r\n\r\nAshay: The way we implemented this is by creating a unique use case id or you call it namespace. So, the problem is -> A requests a batch token which it can pass to B but B would need some permissions to get Tx token back from A's batch token. To solve it, when A onboards Tx Token issuer, it creates a use case id unique to A which is registered with Tx token issuer. Every time Tx Token issuer issues a 'batch token' to A, it will find the usecaseId and put it in batch token. If B gets batch token from A (or steals it somehow), then B will not be able to get a Tx token back from issuer. Tx token issuer maintains an allowlist against each unique usecaseId, for who is allowed to get token back for that use case it. To get token back, B has to register itself to Tx token issuer against A's usecaseId.\r\n\r\nWe call services like A, the \"batch token initiator\" and services like B \"the batch rehydrator\" as it rehydates Tx token back from batch token. \r\n\r\nEdge case - A can play both roles - initiator and rehydrator. This might lead to problem of infinite exchanges. But not sure if its a problem. It may be a problem for some use case. Tx token can also keep a counter in batch token and Tx token to ensure only finite amount of exchanges are allowed.\r\n\r\nOverall, how does the proposal sound? I think we cannot write all this into a complexity into RFC. For RFC, we can keep it simple that there can be long lived batch token and Tx token must implement some sort of access control to ensure only authorized services can convert the batch to Tx token.\r\n\r\nSupporting batch has been super important for my company and major milestone as many critical workflows are model on such event based architecture. \r\n\r\nIf everything looks good, I can create PR for it and take a stab at updating our draft.",

          "body": "Notes from call on: 11/22/2024\r\n\r\n- (Pieter): Maybe we need to think about expiry differently here. Rather than introducing ..., we formulate a different view about expiry\r\n- (Atul): TraTs have a freedom because they are short lived. Can we have a separate mechanism for handling long-lived transactions\r\n- (George): How do we address long lived transactions? We can say that is not TraTs, but some other mechanism, similar to the work done in the ID-Chaining. Have some sort of assertion grant that can be used to mint a new transaction token.\r\n- (Joe): What about a one-time voucher? That keeps the context across separate transactions\r\n- (Pieter): Is that just a refresh token? \r\n- (Joe): You may not be granted ...\r\n- (Ashay): How we thought about it: We never changed the definition of the TraT (it always expires quickly - short lived). The service would request a new token before the TraT expiry, which mints something else that can be used to mint a new TraT later. If the claims in the TraT need to be \"refreshed\" / modified, then the TraT service. In the issuance of the voucher, the TraT service can mark certain fields as \"updateable\". You mark the fields as refreshable in the beginning, when the TraT is being issued.\r\n- (Pieter): I want to get George's thoughts on whether the short-livedness is ...\r\n- (George): A long-lived part starts to pull in revocation, which makes things complicated. For example, if a user has consented to using certain data for marketing, and when the transaction resumes, the user has rescinded the consent. What happens then?\r\n- (Pieter) The revocation argument is good. Having a token that never expires could be very problematic.\r\n- (George): What Ashay is describing is similar to what Joe described by way of \"vouchers\". In that context, the TraTs are still short-lived, which means that we should look at this as something that is layered above TraTs\r\n- (Atul): I felt the same, but the fields need to be marked updateable at the time of TraT issuance\r\n- (George): It seems the TraT service would then need to know more than just about authorization. If say, I wanted to tokenize PII, then the TraT service would need connections to a lot of other places. This could be 3 layers down in the transaction, the workload 3 levels down now puts the voucher in the batch stream. How does the TraT service know how to refresh that data?\r\n- (Pieter): I remember we had text in section 2.3 about lifetime. You cannot extend the TraT to beyond the lifetime of the original access token, so there is an upper bound. If we start tinkering with that, we have an issue. Allowing TraTs to be refreshed are goign to have downstream effects.\r\n- (Ashay): In our implementations, it gathers context from other services before requesting a new TraT\r\n- (Atul): I was going to do the same thing.\r\n- (George): The thing that needs the TraT can get the refreshed versions of the data, and pass that in the request context object, and request the new token. From a standards perspective, we need to understand what this would mean.\r\n- (Atul): ...\r\n- (Ashay): Teams responsible for specific functions can't be responsible for rebuilding the context. So we start with everything being immutable, and it can evolve as the business needs become apparent. So by default nothing is mutable.\r\n- (Ashay): How does this work? It is going to complicate the spec, can you change an RFC?\r\n- (Atul): No\r\n- (George): We can have a separate RFC which says how we should use TraTs for batching. I do think that since we are moving toward event driven models, this is important as a capability. \r\n- (Atul): Is TraTs without batching a valuable spec (can it be used without batching?)\r\n- (George): There are a lot of use cases where TraTs can be used today (without batching).\r\n- (Joe): There's also a big push for autonomous agents, (not just batch). \r\n- (George): The agent question is very interesting, but it feels like a layer on top of TraTs\r\n- (Pieter): I think TraTs are valuable as they are today. But we will almost certainly have to do a follow on spec. Can we have a proper problem definition that we can do a write up. That's the kind of thing that opens up security issues. In section 2.3 (expiry)\r\n- (Ashay): We did implement TraTs first, but the async question came up later, and it broke things that required batch processes. A call chain will almost always include some batch processes. At the beginning of the transaction, no one knows how long it is going to last\r\n- (George):  I agree. For the API invocation use case, you can look at your SLA and make good assumptions about transaction duration, but that only covers 80% of the transactions in an enterprise. But I have a lot of questions about how you build that layering in an industry standard way. So in your example, what is coming to \"workload 3\" in is a TraT, and it needs a voucher to rebuild a TraT later, which goes on the queue. Then when \"workload 4\" picks it up, and this can happen again downstream. We need to think through all those implications, and understand what they mean. It sounds like Ashay has a lot of use cases, but we need to define a lot of use cases.\r\n- (Ashay): Since this topic is so complex, it is good for us to provide guidance.\r\n- (Ashay): Can we just add expiry to each TraT field? \r\n- (Pieter): Does this modify the expiry property of the token?\r\n- (Ashay): This is not modifying the expiry of the token. \r\n- (George): So we have the rctx, if we say nothing about it, then anyone could ..\r\n- (George): The tctx is just a JSON blob, so you could put anything you want there. So another spec could define the expiry field in that.\r\n- (Pieter): Can I ask a question? We could have a situation where the TraT has expired, but the data context hasn't expired. So there is a new concept that the data expiry is longer than TraT expiry.\r\n- (Ashay): The real-world example is user consent. So EU allows 24 hours to enforce change. If a queue takes 6 days, then the new TraT has to refresh the new consent property.\r\n- (Pieter): \r\n- (George): ",

Not also, that a workload is not required to process the `purp` claim from an authorization point of view. I can depend on what the request is and risk, etc. \r\n\r\nThe intended authorization model is that the Transaction Token Service acts as a primary PDP when issuing the transaction token and then each workload can run it's own policy (if desired) to further evaluate the validity of the request.",

Our implementation was a bit more aligned with Token Exchange where the scope is copied (or narrowed down) to the internally used transaction token. So most deployments rely on having the scope in the \"scope\" claim. There is also pretty good library support for the scope claim already.\r\n\r\nThat said, it might not be an issue of semantics, but rather of ownership. At least in our implementation, scope values are defined (and owned) by the services which enforce the scope (also in internal calls using transaction tokens) when the internal microservice interface is called. Purpose, on the other hand, is more bound to the use case which needs to be fulfilled and the definition of those use cases will rather be done by the external endpoints (BFFs) and thus also owned by them. The internal microservices will then need to be configured to support purposes defined by several external endpoints. So it might still be worth, having the microservice check the scope it defined to be present when calling its API on top of validating the purpose.",

We\u2019re gradually removing those fields from existing registrations.\r\n\r\n- The media type registrations don\u2019t appear to include a change controller field.\r\n\r\n- The quotation marks around type, subtype, and required and optional parameters can be removed, as should the \u201c(RFC 2046)\u201d after \u201capplication.\u201d\r\n\r\nFinally, please note that RFC 6838 recommends asking the [media-types@ietf.org](mailto:media-types@ietf.org) mailing list for an informal review.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, just let us know.

One of the interesting discussion points was whether the authorization model is consistent throughout the life of the transaction token. For example, maybe the data tier doesn't know about users when it comes to enforcing authorization policy. Maybe that is done through fine-grained entitlements. That keeps the data tier from needing to reach into the user authorization store to determine which data the user can access. Or maybe there is a authorization layer closer to the edge that will redact data the user isn't allowed to see.\r\n\r\nIn either of these cases, should it be possible to get a replacement transaction token that doesn't have a `sub` but does have the list of data tier entitlements that are authorized for this particular request.",

I'm thinking mostly about the case where an internal workload (e.g. like a scheduled job) needs a TraT and has additional details about the transaction that it wants to make immutable. We can say that it is up to the Transaction Token Service (TTS) to determine what data is included in the TraT. How the TTS makes that determination is out of scope for the specification.",

If we were to somehow hint about the `aud` value in the resulting TraT, that is determined by the TTS, so providing that in the request is inconsequential (and the requester has no control over it). It's possible that the same TTS has multiple trust domains, but there could be other ways for it to distinguish which trust domain it is acting on behalf of, such as a different token exchange endpoint URL.\r\n- Similarly, the `exp` value could be used to indicate the expiration of the request itself, or it could be used as a hint to indicate the lifetime of the resulting TraT. Since we have already noted that a TTS may reject JWTs with an unreasonably old `iat` value, we do not need to specify an `exp` value. If we were to hint about the lifetime of the resulting TraT, I feel the requester would need to know a lot more about the transaction than a typical requester such as a general-purpose API gateway would know. I'd rather that the TTS determine the TraT's `exp` based on its policy and understanding of the actual transaction that is being requested. ",

Given everything that goes on in he world of token theft, having this extra constraint can help minimise the impact of token replay (stealing a token from one workload and replaying against another transaction token endpoint and so forth). Are there scenarios where we think the workload would not know which transaction token service it will be presenting its self-signed credential to?\r\n\r\nI also recall that we had some constraint that a transaction token cannot be valid for longer than the original token. This raises the question on what the guidance is for expiry if the exp claim is not present as in this case.

The `txn` claim in the Txn-token provides a unique identifier that when logged by the TTS and each subsequent workload can provide both discovery and auditability of successful and failed transactions. It is therefore strongly RECOMMENDED to use an identifier, unique within the trust domain, for the `txn` value.\r\n",

This is in order to prevent replay of tokens or leakage of PII or other sensitive information via log files. A hash of the Txn-Token may be logged to allow for correlation with the log files of the Txn-Token Service that records issued tokens. Alternatively the JWS payload of a Txn-Token may be logged after the signature has been removed. If the Txn-Token contains PII, then care should be taken in logging the content of the Txn-Token so that the PII does not get logged.\r\n\r\n",
