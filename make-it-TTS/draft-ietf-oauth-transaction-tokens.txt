               draft-ietf-oauth-transaction-tokens-latest

Abstract

   Transaction Tokens (Txn-Tokens) are designed to maintain and
   propagate user identity and authorization context across workloads
   within a trusted domain during the processing of external requests,
   such as API calls.  They ensure that this context is preserved
   throughout the call chain, even when new transactions are initiated
   internally, thereby enhancing security and consistency in complex,
   multi-service architectures.

1.  Introduction

   Modern computing architectures often use multiple independently
   running components called workloads.  In many cases, external
   invocations through interfaces such as APIs result in a number of
   internal workloads being invoked in order to process the external
   invocation.  These workloads often run in virtually or physically
   isolated networks.  These networks and the workloads running within
   their perimeter may be compromised by attackers through software
   supply chain, privileged user compromise or other attacks.  Workloads
   compromised through external attacks, malicious insiders or software
   errors can cause any or all of the following unauthorized actions:

   *  Invocations of workloads in the network without any explicit
      transaction invocation being present.

   *  Arbitrary user impersonation.

   *  Parameter modification or augmentation.

   *  Theft of tokens, such as OAuth access tokens, used to call
      external interfaces and passed to internal workloads to convey
      authorization context.

   The results of these actions are unauthorized access to resources.

2.  Overview

   Transaction Tokens (Txn-Tokens) reduce the risks from such attacks or
   spurious invocations.  A valid Txn-Token indicates a valid
   transaction invocation.  Note that while many transactions are
   initiated via an external event (e.g. internet facing API invocation)
   other transactions are initiated from within the trusted domain.
   Txn-Tokens apply to both externally triggered and internally invoked
   transactions and ensure that the user's identity or a workload that
   made the request is preserved throughout subsequent workload
   invocations.  They preserve any context such as:

   *  Parameters of the original call

   *  Environmental factors, such as IP address of the original caller

   *  Any context that needs to be preserved in the call chain.  This
      includes information that was not in the original request to the
      external endpoint.

   Cryptographically protected Txn-Tokens ensure that downstream
   workloads cannot make unauthorized modifications to such information,
   and cannot make spurious calls.

2.1.  What are Transaction Tokens?

   Txn-Tokens are short-lived, signed JWTs [RFC7519] that assert the
   identity of a user or a workload and assert an authorization context.
   The authorization context provides information expected to remain
   constant during the execution of a call chain as it passes through
   multiple workloads.

2.1.1.  Authorization Context

   Authorization context includes information used for authorization,
   accounting and auditing purposes and often contains information about
   the request being made.  A key aspect of the authorization context is
   the intent or purpose of the transaction, which should be as narrowly
   defined as possible for the given deployment.  A narrowly scoped
   transaction token reduces the attack surface of captured and replayed
   transaction tokens.

2.2.  Creating Txn-Tokens

2.2.1.  Creation

   Txn-Tokens are typically created when a workload is invoked using an
   endpoint that is externally visible, and is authorized using a
   separate mechanism, such as an OAuth [RFC6749] access token.  The
   externally visible endpoint exchanges the external authorization
   token for a transaction token before sending it to the workload.  The
   transaction token may be obtained through a local interface, or it
   may be requested from a remote server.

   If the transaction token request is made via HTTP to a remote server,
   it MUST use [RFC8693] as described in this specification.  To do
   this, it invokes a special Token Service (the Transaction Token
   Service (TTS)) and provides context that is sufficient for it to
   generate a Txn-Token.

   The context information provided to the TTS MUST include: * the
   identification of the trust domain in which the issued Txn-Token is
   valid * a token which identifies the subject of the Txn-Token (e.g.
   an OAuth access token, a self-issued JWT, etc) * the desired
   authorisation scope for the issued Txn-Token

   Additional contextual information MAY be provided such as: *
   Parameters that are required to be integrity protected for the
   duration of this call * Additional context, such as the incoming IP
   address, User Agent information, or other context that can help the
   TTS to issue the Txn-Token

   The TTS responds to a successful invocation by generating a Txn-
   Token.  The calling workload then uses the Txn-Token to authorize its
   calls to subsequent workloads.  Subsequent workloads may obtain Txn-
   Tokens on their own.  The TTS responds to a successful invocation by
   generating a Txn-Token.  The calling workload then uses the Txn-Token
   to authorize its calls to subsequent workloads.

   If the requesting service does not have an inbound token that it can
   use in its request to the TTS, it generates a self-signed JWT and
   passes that in the request in place of the external authorization
   token.  This can be the case when the external authentication does
   not use an access token or when the requesting service is initiating
   a scheduled internal request on for itself or on behalf of a user of
   the system.

2.3.  Txn-Token Lifetime

   Txn-Tokens are expected to be short-lived (on the order of minutes or
   less), and as a result MUST be used only for the expected duration of
   an external or internal invocation.  If the token or other credential
   (e.g. self-signed JWT) presented to the TTS when requesting a Txn-
   Token has an expiration time, then the TTS MUST NOT issue a Txn-Token
   if the expiration time has passed.  The lifetime of the Txn-Token
   itself MAY exceed the expiration time of the presented token.  The
   expectation is that since Txn-Tokens are short lived and are
   authorizing a specific transaction, extending beyond the lifetime of
   the presented expiration time is not a security risk.  If a long-
   running process such as a batch or offline task is involved, the
   mechanism used to perform the external or internal invocation still
   results in a short-lived Txn-Token.

2.4.  Benefits of Txn-Tokens

   Txn-Tokens prevent unauthorized or unintended invocations by allowing
   a workload to independently verify the identity of the user or
   workload that initiated an external call, as well as any contextual
   information relevant to processing that call.

2.5.  Txn-Token Issuance and Usage Flows

2.5.1.  Basic Flow

   Figure 1 shows the basic flow of how Txn-Tokens are used in a multi-
   workload environment.

              Figure 1: Basic Transaction Tokens Architecture

   1.  External endpoint is invoked using conventional authorization
       mechanism such as an OAuth 2.0 Access token

   2.  External endpoint provides context and incoming authorization
       (e.g., access token) to the TTS

   3.  TTS mints a Txn-Token that provides immutable context for the
       transaction and returns it to the requester

   4.  The external endpoint initiates a call to an internal workloads
       and provides the Txn-Token as authorization

   5.  Subsequent calls to other internal workloads use the same Txn-
       Token to authorize calls

   6.  Responses are provided to calling workloads based on successful
       authorization by the invoked workloads

   7.  Response provided to external endpoint based on successful
       authorization by the invoked workload

   8.  External client is provided a response to the external invocation

2.5.2.  Internally Initiated Txn-Token Flow

   An internal workload may need to initiate a transaction not on the
   basis of a current external request, but as part of a scheduled task
   or in reaction to a specific condition.  The transaction may be
   requested on behalf of the identity of the requesting workload or as
   an impersonation on behalf of a specific user chosen based on
   information accessible to the workload.

               Figure 2: Internally Initiated Txn-Token Flow

   In the diagram above, steps 5-6 are the same as in Section 2.5.1.

   1.  A microservice determines that it needs to initiate a request on
       behalf of a user in response to a scheduled timer or other
       trigger.

   2.  The internal microservice authenticates to the token service and
       makes a request for a Txn-Token.  The request contains
       information about the transaction along with optional additional
       authorization credentials

   3.  TTS authorizes the requester and then mints a Txn-Token that
       provides immutable context for the transaction and returns it to
       the requester

   4.  The originating microservice then contacts another internal
       microservice and provides the Txn-Token as authorization

3.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Terminology

   Workload:  A running instance of software executing for a specific
      purpose.  Examples of workloads include containerized
      microservices, monolithic services and infrastructure services
      such as managed databases.

   Trust Domain:  A logical grouping of systems that share a common set
      of security controls and policies.  In practice this may include a
      virtually or physically separated network, which contains two or
      more workloads.  The workloads within a Trust Domain may be
      invoked only through published interfaces.

   External Endpoint:  A published interface to a Trust Domain that
      results in the invocation of a workload within the Trust Domain.
      In practice, the external endpoint may be acccessed through a
      gateway service as described in the WIMSE architecture
      [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].

   Call Chain:  A sequence of invocations that results from the
      invocation of an external endpoint.

   Transaction Token (Txn-Token):  A signed JWT with a short lifetime,
      providing immutable information about the user or workload,
      certain parameters of the call, and specific contextual attributes
      of the call.  The Txn-Token is used to authorize subsequent calls
      in the call chain.

   Transaction Token Service (TTS):  A special service within the Trust
      Domain that issues Txn-Tokens to requesting workloads.  Each Trust
      Domain using Txn-Tokens MUST have exactly one logical TTS.

5.  Txn-Token Format

   A Txn-Token is a JSON Web Token [RFC7519] protected by a JSON Web
   Signature [RFC7515].  The following describes the required values in
   a Txn-Token:

5.1.  JWT Header

   In the JWT Header:

   *  The typ Header Parameter MUST be present and MUST have the value
      txntoken+jwt.

   *  Key rotation of the signing key SHOULD be supported through the
      use of a kid Header Parameter.

   Figure 3 is a non-normative example of the JWT Header of a Txn-Token

   {
       "typ": "txntoken+jwt",
       "alg": "RS256",
       "kid": "identifier-to-key"
   }

                    Figure 3: Example: Txn-Token Header

5.2.  JWT Body Claims

   The transaction token body follows the JWT format and includes
   existing JWT claims as well as defines new claims.  These claims are
   described below:

   iss:  OPTIONAL The iss claim as defined in [RFC7519] is not required
      as Txn-Tokens are bound to a single Trust Domain as defined by the
      aud claim and often the signing keys are known.  The iss claim
      MUST be used in cases where the signing keys are not
      predetermined.

   iat:  REQUIRED The issued at time of the Txn-Token as defined in
      [RFC7519]

   aud:  REQUIRED This claim, defined in [RFC7519], MUST identify the
      Trust Domain in which the Txn-Token is valid.  A Txn-Token MUST
      NOT be accepted outside the Trust Domain identified by the aud
      claim.

   exp:  REQUIRED Expiry time of the Txn-Token as defined in [RFC7519]

   txn:  REQUIRED A unique transaction identifier as defined in
      Section 2.2 of [RFC8417].

   sub:  REQUIRED This claim represents the principal of the transaction
      as defined by Section 4.1.2 of [RFC7519].  The value MUST be
      unique within the context of the aud Trust Domain.  Note: Unlike
      OpenID Connect, the sub claim is NOT associated with the iss
      claim.

   scope:  REQUIRED The scope claim is defined in Section 4.2 of
      [RFC8693].  Note that the value of this claim is determined by the
      TTS and is not required to match the requested scope nor the scope
      in any supplied external token.

   tctx:  OPTIONAL A JSON object that contains values that remain
      immutable throughout the call chain.

   rctx:  OPTIONAL A JSON object that describes the environmental
      context of the requested transaction.

   req_wl:  REQUIRED.  A StringOrURI value that identifies the workload
      that requested the Txn-Token.

5.2.1.  Scope claim

   The scope claim captures, as narrowly as possible, the purpose of
   this particular transaction.  The values used for this claim are
   defined by the TTS as representative of the authorization model
   defined by the Trust Domain.  The value may be literately and
   semantically different from, and represent an intent narrower, than a
   scope value issued to an external client.  How a given deployment
   represents the authorization model within the Trust Domain is at its
   discretion and not prescribed by this specification.

5.2.2.  Requester Context

   The Txn-Token SHOULD contain an rctx claim.  This MAY include the IP
   address information of the originating requestor, as well as
   information about the computational entity that requested the Txn-
   Token and contextual attributes of the originating request itself.

   The JSON value of the rctx claim MAY include any values the TTS
   determines are interesting to downstream services that rely on the
   Txn-Token.  The following claims are defined so that if they are
   included, they have the following meaning:

   *  req_ip The IP address of the requester.  This MAY be the end-user
      or a process that initiated the Transaction.

   *  authn The authentication method used to identify the requester.
      Its value is a string that uniquely identifies the method used.

   The following is a non-normative example of an rctx claim initiated
   by an external call:

   {
       "rctx": {
         "req_ip": "69.151.72.123", // env context of external call
         "authn": "urn:ietf:rfc:6749" // env context of external call
       }
   }

5.2.3.  Transaction Context

   The Txn-Token SHOULD contain an tctx claim.  The value of this claim
   is a JSON object that contains name/value pairs (wherein the value
   could itself be an object), which together assert the details that
   remain immutable through the call-chain where this Txn-Token is used.

   Txn-Tokens are primarily used to assure identity and context for a
   transaction, and the content of this field is a critical part of that
   context.

   Whereas the rctx field contains environmental values related to the
   request, the tctx field contains the actual authorizaton details that
   are determined by the TTS.  These values are used by services using
   the Txn-Token to reliably obtain specific parameters needed to
   perform their work.  The content of the tctx field is determined by
   the TTS and they may be computed internally or from parameters it
   receives from the service that requests the Txn-Token.

   The following is a non-normative example of an tctx claim initiated
   by an external call:

   "tctx": {
     "action": "BUY", // parameter of external call
     "ticker": "MSFT", // parameter of external call
     "quantity": "100", // parameter of external call
     "customer_type": { // computed value not present in external call
       "geo": "US",
       "level": "VIP"
     }
   }

5.2.4.  Example

   The figure below Figure 4 shows a non-normative example of the JWT

                     Figure 4: Example: Txn-Token Body

   A Txn-Token from an internal request would look much the same except
   the rctx and tctx field claims would be populated with information
   from the initiating workloads request.

6.  Txn-Token Service (TTS)

   A Txn-Token Service (TTS) uses [RFC8693] as described in this
   specification if it issues transaction tokens in response to HTTP
   requests.  The unique properties of the Txn-Token requests and
   responses are described below.  The TTS MAY optionally support other
   OAuth 2.0 endpoints and features, but that is not a requirement for
   it to be a TTS.

   Each Trust Domain that uses Txn-Tokens MUST have exactly one logical
   TTS.

7.  Requesting Txn-Tokens

   A workload requests a Txn-Token from a TTS.  If the transaction token
   request is made via HTTP to a remote server, it MUST use [RFC8693] as
   described in this specification.  Txn-Tokens may be requested for
   both externally originating or internally originating requests.  The
   profile describes how required and optional context can be provided
   to the TTS in order for the Txn-Token to be issued.  The request to
   obtain a Txn-Token using this method is called a Txn-Token Request,
   and a successful response is called a Txn-Token Response.  The Txn-
   Token profile of the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange [RFC8693] is described
   below.

7.1.  Txn-Token Request

   A workload requesting a Txn-Token provides the TTS with proof of its
   identity (client authentication), the purpose of the Txn-Token and
   optionally any additional context relating to the transaction being
   performed.  Most of these elements are provided by the OAuth 2.0
   Token Exchange specification and the rest are defined as new
   parameters.  Additionally, this profile defines a new token type URN
   urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:txn_token which is used by the
   requesting workload to identify that it is requesting the Txn-Token
   Response to contain a Txn-Token.

   To request a Txn-Token the workload invokes the OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749]
   token endpoint with the following parameters:

   *  grant_type REQUIRED.  The value MUST be set to
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange.

   *  audience REQUIRED.  The value MUST be set to the Trust Domain
      name.

   *  scope REQUIRED.  A space-delimited list of case-sensitive strings
      where the value(s) MUST represent the specific purpose or intent
      of the transaction.

   *  requested_token_type REQUIRED.  The value MUST be
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:txn_token

   *  subject_token REQUIRED.  The value MUST contain a token that
      represent the subject of the transaction.  The manner in which the
      subject is represented in the subject_token depends on the
      subject_token_type.  The subject_token MAY be:

      -  An inbound token received by an external endpoint (e.g. an API
         Gateway)

      -  A self-signed JWT constructed by a workload initiating a
         transaction

      -  An unsigned JSON object constructed by a workload initiating a
         transaction

      -  Any other format that is understood by the TTS

      The type of the subject_token field is identified by
      subject_token_type.

   *  subject_token_type REQUIRED.  The value MUST indicate the type of
      the token or value present in the subject_token parameter

   The following additional parameters are RECOMMENDED to be present in
   a Txn-Token Request:

   *  request_context OPTIONAL.  This parameter contains a JSON object
      which represents the context of this transaction.

   *  request_details OPTIONAL.  This parameter contains a JSON object
      which contains additional details about the request.  This could
      include API parameters, authorization criteria or other details
      the requester would like to pass to the TTS.  The TTS uses this
      data along with other information at its disposal to construct the
      txct JSON object (if required).

   All parameters are encoded using the "application/x-www-form-
   urlencoded" format per Appendix B of [RFC6749].

   The figure below Figure 5 shows a non-normative example of a Txn-
   Token Request.  Line breaks added for readability.

                    Figure 5: Example: Txn-Token Request

7.2.  Subject Token Types

   The subject_token_type parameter value MUST be a URI [RFC3986].  It
   MAY be:

   *  Any one of the subject token types described in Section 3 of OAuth
      2.0 Token Exchange [RFC8693] except the Refresh Token type (i.e.,
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token).

   *  A URN type name when the subject token is a self-signed JWT, as
      described below.

   *  A URN type name when the subject token is an unsigned JSON object,
      as described below.

   *  A custom URN agreed to between requesters and the TTS.  The TTS
      MAY support other token formats, which MAY be specified in the
      subject_token_type parameter.

7.2.1.  Self-Signed Subject Token Type

   A requester MAY use a self-signed JWT as a subject_token value.  In
   that case, the requester MUST set the subject_token_type value to:
   urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:self_signed.  This self-signed JWT
   MUST contain the following claims:

   *  iss: The unique identifier of the requesting workload.

   *  sub: The subject for whom the Txn-Token is being requested.  The
      TTS SHALL use this value in determining the sub value in the Txn-
      Token issued in the response to this request.

   *  aud: The unique identifier of the TTS.  The TTS SHALL verify that
      this value matches its own unique identifier.

   *  iat: The time at which the self-signed JWT was created.  Note that
      the TTS may reject self-signed tokens with an iat value that is
      unreasonably far in the past or future.

   *  exp: The expiration time for the JWT.  Section 9.1 provides
      guidance on setting the expiry of a Txn-Token.

   The self-signed JWT MAY contain other claims.

7.2.2.  Unsigned JSON Object Subject Token Type

   A requester MAY use an unsigned JSON object as a subject_token value.
   In that case, the requester MUST set the subject_token_type value to:
   urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:unsigned_json.  The JSON object in
   the subject token MUST contain the following fields:

   *  sub: The subject for whom the Txn-Token is being requested.  The
      TTS SHALL use this value in determining the sub value in the Txn-
      Token issued in the response to this request.

   The unsigned JSON object MAY contain other fields, and the TTS MAY
   consider them when generating the Txn-Token.

7.3.  Txn-Token Request Processing

   When the TTS receives a Txn-Token Request it:

   *  MUST validate the requesting workload client authentication and
      determine if that workload is authorized to obtain the Txn-Tokens
      with the requested value(s).  The authorization policy for
      determining such issuance is out of scope for this specification.

   *  Next, the TTS MUST validate the subject_token, including verifying
      the signature, if it is signed.

   *  The TTS determines the value to specify as the sub of the Txn-
      Token and MUST ensure the sub value is unique within the Trust
      Domain defined by the aud claim.

   *  The TTS MUST set the iat claim to the time of issuance of the Txn-
      Token.

   *  The TTS MUST set the aud claim to an identifier representing the
      Trust Domain of the TTS.  If the TTS supports multiple Trust
      Domains, then it MUST determine the correct aud value for this
      request.

   *  The TTS MUST set the exp claim to the expiry time of the Txn-
      Token.  The TTS MAY consider any exp value present in the
      subject_token parameter of the Txn-Token Request in determining
      the exp value of the resulting Txn-Token.

   *  The TTS MUST set the txn claim to a unique ID specific to this
      transaction.

   *  The TTS MAY set the iss claim of the Txn-Token to a value defining
      the entity that signed the Txn-Token.  This claim MUST be omitted
      if not set.

   *  The TTS MUST evaluate the value specified in the scope parameter
      of the request to determine the scope claim of the issued Txn-
      Token.

   *  If a request_context parameter is present in the Txn-Token
      Request, the data SHOULD be added to the rctx object of the Txn-
      Token.

   *  If a request_details parameter is present in the Txn-Token
      Request, then the TTS SHOULD propagate the data from the
      request_details object into the claims in the tctx object as
      authorized by the TTS authorization policy for the requesting
      client.

   The TTS MAY provide additional processing and verification that is
   outside the scope of this specification.

7.4.  Txn-Token Response

   A successful response to a Txn-Token Request by a TTS is called a
   Txn-Token Response.  The following values defined in [RFC8693] MUST
   be included in the Txn-Token Response:

   *  The token_type value MUST be set to N_A per guidance in OAuth 2.0
      Token Exchange [RFC8693]

   *  The access_token value MUST be the Txn-Token JWT

   *  The issued_token_type value MUST bet set to
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:txn_token

   The Txn-Token Response MUST NOT include the refresh_token value.

   If the TTS responds with an error, the error response is as described
   in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].

   Figure 6 shows a non-normative example of a Txn-Token Response.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "token_type": "N_A",
     "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:txn_token",
     "access_token": "eyJCI6IjllciJ9...Qedw6rx"
   }

                   Figure 6: Example: Txn-Token Response

7.5.  Mutual Authentication of the Txn-Token Request

   A TTS and requesting workload MUST authenticate each other (mutual
   authentication).  Workloads MUST authenticate the TTS to ensure that
   they do not disclose sensitive information, such as OAuth access
   tokens, to a rogue TTS.  A TTS MUST authenticate a workload to ensure
   the workload is authorized to request a transaction token.

   Workloads SHOULD use the https scheme to secure the communication
   channel and authenticate the TTS.  When using https, TLS certificates
   MUST be checked according to Section 4.3.4 of [RFC9110].  At the time
   of this writing, TLS version 1.3 [RFC8446] is the most recent
   version.

   Workloads SHOULD authenticate to a Transaction Token Server using
   asymmetric (public-key based) methods or signed client authentication
   JWTs in accordance with [RFC7523].

   Examples of public-key based authentication include those defined in
   OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound
   Access Tokens [RFC8705], Workload Authentication Using Mutual TLS
   [I-D.ietf-wimse-mutual-tls], WIMSE Workload-to-Workload
   Authentication with HTTP Signatures [I-D.ietf-wimse-http-signature]
   and WIMSE Workload Proof Token [I-D.ietf-wimse-wpt].

8.  Using Txn-Tokens

   Txn-Tokens need to be communicated between workloads that depend upon
   them to authorize the request.  Such workloads will often present
   HTTP [RFC9110] interfaces for being invoked by other workloads.  This
   section specifies the HTTP header the invoking workload MUST use to
   communicate the Txn-Token to the invoked workload, when the invoked
   workload presents an HTTP interface.  Note that the standard HTTP
   Authorization header MUST NOT be used because that may be used by the
   workloads for other purposes.

8.1.  Txn-Token HTTP Header

   A workload that invokes another workload using HTTP and needs to
   present a Txn-Token to the invoked workload MUST use the HTTP Header
   Txn-Token to communicate the Txn-Token in the HTTP Request.  The
   value of this header MUST be exactly one Txn-Token.

9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Txn-Token Lifetime

   A Txn-Token is not resistant to replay attacks.  A long-lived Txn-
   Token therefore represents a risk if it is stored in a file,
   discovered by an attacker, and then replayed.  For this reason, a
   Txn-Token lifetime must be kept short, not exceeding the lifetime of
   a call-chain.  Even for long-running "batch" jobs, a longer-lived
   access token should be used to initiate the request to the batch
   endpoint.  It then obtains short-lived Txn-Tokens that may be used to
   authorize the call to downstream services in the call-chain.

   Because Txn-Tokens are short-lived, the Txn-Token response from the
   TTS does not contain the refresh_token field.  A Txn-Token cannot be
   issued by presenting a refresh_token.

9.2.  Access Tokens

   When creating Txn-Tokens, the Txn-Token MUST NOT contain the Access
   Token presented to the external endpoint.  If an Access Token is
   included in a Txn-Token, an attacker may extract the Access Token
   from the Txn-Token, and replay it to any Resource Server that can
   accept that Access Token.  Txn-Token expiry does not protect against
   this attack since the Access Token may remain valid even after the
   Txn-Token has expired.

9.3.  Subject Token Types

   A service requesting a Txn-Token SHOULD provide an incoming token if
   it has one that it used itself to authorize a caller, and if it
   directly correlates with the downstream call chain it needs the Txn-
   Token for.  In the absence of an appropriate incoming token, the
   requesting service MAY use a self-signed JWT, an unsigned JSON object
   or any other format to represent the details of the requester to the
   TTS.

9.4.  Use of 'actor_token'

   If using the actor_token and actor_token_type parameters of the OAuth
   2.0 Token Exchange specification [RFC8693], both parameters MUST be
   present in the request.  The actor_token can authenticate the
   identity of the requesting workload.

9.5.  Scope Processing

   The authorization model within a Trust Domain boundary may be quite
   different from the authorization model (e.g. OAuth scopes) used with
   clients external to the Trust Domain.  This makes managing
   unintentional scope increase a critical aspect of the TTS.  The TTS
   MUST ensure that the requested scope of the Txn-Token is equal or
   less than the scope(s) identified in the subject_token.

9.6.  Unique Transaction Identifier

   A transaction token conveys user identity and authorization context
   across workloads in a call chain.  The txn claim is a unique
   identifier that, when logged by the TTS and workloads, enables
   discovery and auditing of successful and failed transactions.  The
   txn value SHOULD be unique within the Trust Domain.

9.7.  TTS Discovery

   A workload may use various mechanisms to determine which instance of
   a TTS to interact with.  Workloads MUST retrieve configuration
   information from a trusted source to minimize the risk of a threat
   actor providing malicious configuration data that points to an
   instance of a TTS under it's control.  Such a service could be used
   to collect Access Tokens sent as part of the Transaction Token
   Request message.

   To mitigate this risk, workloads SHOULD authenticate the service
   providing the configuration information and verify the integrity of
   the configuration information.  This ensures that no unauthorized
   entity can insert or alter configuration data.  The workload SHOULD
   use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to authenticate the endpoint and
   secure the communication channel.  Additionally, application-layer
   signatures or message authentication codes MAY be used to detect any
   tampering with the configuration information.

9.8.  Workload Configuration Protection

   A deployment may include multiple instances of a TTS to improve
   resiliency, reduce latency and enhance scalability.  A workload may
   be configured to access more than one instance of a TTS to ensure
   reliability or reduce latency for transaction token requests.  The
   workload configuration should be protected against unauthorized
   addition or removal of TTS instances.  An attacker may perform a
   denial of service attack or degrade the performance of a system by
   removing an instance of a TTS from the workload configuration.

9.9.  TTS Authentication

   A workload may accidently send a transaction token request to a
   service that is not a TTS, or an attacker may attempt to impersonate
   a TTS in order to gain access to transaction token requests which
   includes sensitive information like access tokens.  To minimise the
   risk of leaking sensitive information like access tokens that are
   included in the transaction token request, the workload MUST ensure
   that it authenticates the TTS and only contact instances of the TTS
   that is authorized to issue transaction tokens.

9.10.  TTS Key Rotation

   The TTS may need to rotate signing keys.  When doing so, it MAY adopt
   the key rotation practices in Section 10.1.1 of [OpenIdConnect].

9.11.  Transaction Tokens Are Not Authentication Credentials

   A workload MUST NOT use a transaction token to authenticate itself to
   another workload, service or the TTS.  Transaction tokens represents
   information relevant to authorization decisions and are not workload
   identity credentials.  Authentication between the workload and the
   TTS is described in Section 7.5.  The mechanisms used by workloads to
   authenticate to other workloads, services or system components is out
   of scope of this specification.

9.12.  Replacing Transaction Tokens

   A service within a call chain may choose to replace the Txn-Token.
   This can typically happen if the service wants to change (add to,
   remove, or modify) the context of the current Txn-Token

   To get a replacement Txn-Token, a service will request a new Txn-
   Token from the TTS and provide the current Txn-Token and other
   parameters in the request.

9.12.1.  TTS Responsibilities

   A TTS MUST exercise caution when issuing replacement Txn-Tokens,
   since replacing Txn-Tokens with arbitrary values negates the primary
   purpose of having Txn-Tokens.  When issuing replacement Txn-Tokens, a
   TTS:

   *  MAY enable modifications to asserted values that reduce the scope
      of permitted actions

   *  MAY enable additional asserted values

   *  MUST NOT enable modification to asserted values that expand the
      scope of permitted actions

   *  MUST NOT modify txn, sub, and aud values of the Txn-Token in the
      request

   *  MUST NOT remove any of the existing requesting workload
      identifiers from the req_wl claim

   *  SHOULD NOT issue replacement Txn-token with lifetime exceeding the
      lifetime of the originally presented token

   *  MUST append the workload identifier of the workload requesting the
      replacement to the req_wl claim using the character , as the
      separator between individual workload identifiers.

10.  Privacy Considerations

10.1.  Obfuscation of Personal Information

   Some rctx and tctx claims may be considered personal information in
   some jurisdictions and if so their values need to be obfuscated.  For
   example, originating IP address (req_ip) is often considered personal
   information and in that case must be protected through some
   obfuscation method (e.g. salted SHA256).

10.2.  Logging

   Complete Txn-Tokens MUST NOT be logged verbatim.  This is in order to
   prevent replay of tokens or leakage of PII or other sensitive
   information via log files.  A hash of the Txn-Token may be logged to
   allow for correlation with the log files of the TTS that records
   issued tokens.  Alternatively the JWS payload of a Txn-Token may be
   logged after the signature has been removed.  If the Txn-Token
   contains PII, then care should be taken in logging the content of the
   Txn-Token so that the PII does not get logged.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers the following token type identifiers to
   the "OAuth URI" subregistry of the "OAuth Parameters"
   [IANA.OAuth.Parameters] registry.  It also registers the following
   claims defined in Section Section 5.2 in the IANA JSON Web Token
   Claims Registry defined in [RFC7519].  It also registers the Media
   Type [IANA.MediaTypes] "txntoken+jwt" as defined in the section
   Section 5.1.

11.1.  OAuth URI Subregistry Contents

11.3.  IANA Media Type Registration Contents

   The following entry will be proposed using the IANA Media Type
   registration [IANA.MediaTypes] form.

   *  Type Name: application

   *  Subtype Name: txntoken+jwt

   *  Change Controller: IETF

   *  Required Parameters: N/A.

   *  Optional Parameters: N/A.

   *  Encoding Considerations: 7-bit text

   *  Security Considerations:

      1.  The media type is used to identify JWTs that may be used as
          Transaction Tokens.  It is a piece of data, and may not
          contain executable content.

      2.  Transaction Tokens are short-lived tokens used within a
          trusted environment, so there are no privacy considerations.
          Transaction Tokens are unmodifiable tokens, which need
          integrity protection.

      3.  The JWTs representing Transaction Tokens are signed, and
          therefore are integrity protected.  A recipient of a
          Transaction Token must verify the signature on the Transaction
          Token before using it.

      4.  There are no additional security considerations specific to
          the use of JWTs as Transaction Tokens

      5.  The Transaction Tokens format does not require the use of
          links within the token.  If links are used by specific
          instances of Transaction Tokens, then their interpretation is
          usage specific

   *  Interoperability Considerations: Transaction Tokens inherit all
      interoperability properties of JWTs.

   *  Published Specification: this document (when published)

   *  Application Usage: Any application supporting the use of JWTs

   *  Fragment Identifier Consideration: N/A.

   *  Restrictions on Usage: Any application supporting the use of JWTs

   *  Intended Usage: Common

   *  Contact Person: Atul Tulshibagwale

11.4.  HTTP Header

   The header name Txn-Token is proposed to be added to the HTTP Field
   Name Registry [IANA.HTTP.FieldNames] as an unstructured Header Field.
   This header is defined in the section Section 8.1.  The following
   entry will be proposed in the HTTP Field Name Registry.  Note that
   this is an unstructured field, therefore the value of the Type field
   is left empty as shown below:

   *  Field Name: Txn-Token

   *  Type:

   *  Status: permanent

   *  Specification Document: Section Section 8.1 of this document

   *  Comment: The Authorization header cannot be used for Txn-tokens
      because that may be used for service-to-service authorization, and
      the services may simultaneously require the use of Txn-tokens to
      convey detailed immutable information such as user identity and
      details of fine-grained authorization that are included in the
      Txn-token.
