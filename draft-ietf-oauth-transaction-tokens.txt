               draft-ietf-oauth-transaction-tokens-latest

Abstract

   Transaction Tokens (Txn-Tokens) enable workloads in a trusted domain
   to ensure that user identity and authorization context of an external
   programmatic request, such as an API invocation, are preserved and
   available to all workloads that are invoked as part of processing
   such a request.  Txn-Tokens also enable workloads within the trusted
   domain to optionally immutably assert to downstream workloads that
   they were invoked in the call chain of the request.

1.  Introduction

   Modern computing architectures often use multiple independently
   running components called workloads.  In many cases, external
   invocations through externally visible interfaces such as APIs result
   in a number of internal workloads being invoked in order to process
   the external invocation.  These workloads often run in virtually or
   physically isolated networks.  These networks and the workloads
   running within their perimeter may be compromised by attackers
   through software supply chain, privileged user compromise or other
   attacks.  Workloads compromised through external attacks, malicious
   insiders or software errors can cause any or all of the following
   unauthorized actions:

   *  Invocations of workloads in the network without any external
      invocation being present

   *  Arbitrary user impersonation

   *  Parameter modification or augmentation

   The results of these actions are unauthorized access to resources.

2.  Overview

   Transaction Tokens (Txn-Token) are a means to mitigate damage from
   such attacks or spurious invocations.  A valid Txn-Token indicates a
   valid external invocation.  They ensure that the identity of the user
   or a workload that made the external request is preserved throughout
   subsequent workload invocations.  They preserve any context such as:

   *  Parameters of the original call

   *  Environmental factors, such as IP address of the original caller

   *  Any computed context that needs to be preserved in the call chain.
      This includes information that was not in the original request to
      the external endpoint.

   Cryptographically protected Txn-Tokens ensure that downstream
   workloads cannot make unauthorized modifications to such information,
   and cannot make spurious calls without the presence of an external
   trigger.

2.1.  What are Transaction Tokens?

   Txn-Tokens are short-lived, signed JWTs [RFC7519] that assert the
   identity of a user or a workload and assert an authorization context.
   The authorization context provides information expected to remain
   constant during the execution of a call chain as it passes through
   multiple workloads.

2.2.  Creating Txn-Tokens

2.2.1.  Initial Creation

   Txn-Tokens are typically created when a workload is invoked using an
   endpoint that is externally visible, and is authorized using a
   separate mechanism, such as an OAuth [RFC6749] access token or an
   OpenID Connect [OpenIdConnect] ID token.  This workload then performs
   an OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange [RFC8693] to obtain a Txn-Token.  To do
   this, it invokes a special Token Service (the Txn-Token Service) and
   provides context that is sufficient for it to generate a Txn-Token.
   This context MAY include:

   *  The external authorization token (e.g., the OAuth access token)

   *  Parameters that are required to be bound for the duration of this
      call

   *  Additional context, such as the incoming IP address, User Agent
      information, or other context that can help the Txn-Token Service
      to issue the Txn-Token

   The Txn-Token Service responds to a successful invocation by
   generating a Txn-Token.  The calling workload then uses the Txn-Token
   to authorize its calls to subsequent workloads.  Subsequent workloads
   may obtain Txn-Tokens on their own.

   If the requesting service does not have an inbound token that it can
   use in its request to the Txn-Token Service, it generates a self-
   signed JWT and passes that in the request in place of the external
   authorization token.

2.2.2.  Replacement Txn-Tokens

   A service within a call chain may choose to replace the Txn-Token.
   This can typically happen if the service wants to add to the context
   of the current Txn-Token

   To get a replacement Txn-Token, a service will request a new Txn-
   Token from the Txn-Token Service and provide the current Txn-Token
   and other parameters in the request.  The Txn-Token service must
   exercise caution in what kinds of replacement requests it supports so
   as to not negate the entire value of Txn-Tokens.

2.3.  Txn-Token Lifetime

   Txn-Tokens are expected to be short-lived (order of minutes, e.g., 5
   minutes), and as a result MAY be used only for the expected duration
   of an external invocation.  Except in the case where the request is
   made using a self-signed JWT, if the token or other credential
   presented to the Txn-Token service when requesting a Txn-Token has an
   expiration time, then the Txn-Token MUST NOT exceed the lifetime of
   the originally presented token or credential.  If a long-running
   process such as an batch or offline task is involved, it can use a
   separate mechanism to perform the external invocation, but the
   resulting Txn-Token is still short-lived.

2.4.  Benefits of Txn-Tokens

   Txn-Tokens help prevent spurious invocations by ensuring that a
   workload receiving an invocation can independently verify the user or
   workload on whose behalf an external call was made and any context
   relevant to the processing of the call.

2.5.  Txn-Token Issuance and Usage Flows

2.5.1.  Basic Flow

   Figure 1 shows the basic flow of how Txn-Tokens are used in a multi-
   workload environment.

              Figure 1: Basic Transaction Tokens Architecture

   1.  External endpoint is invoked using conventional authorization
       mechanism such as an OAuth 2.0 Access token

   2.  External endpoint provides context and incoming authorization
       (e.g., access token) to the Txn-Token Service

   3.  Txn-Token Service mints a Txn-Token that provides immutable
       context for the transaction and returns it to the requester

   4.  The external endpoint initiates a call to an internal
       microservice and provides the Txn-Token as authorization

   5.  Subsequent calls to other internal microservices use the same
       Txn-Token to authorize calls

   6.  Responses are provided to callers based on successful
       authorization by the invoked microservices

   7.  External client is provided a response to the external invocation

2.5.2.  Replacement Txn-Token Flow

   An intermediate service may decide to obtain a replacement Txn-Token
   from the Txn-Token service.  That flow is described below in Figure 2

                    Figure 2: Replacement Txn-Token Flow

   In the diagram above, steps 1-5 are the same as in Section 2.5.1

   6.  An intermediate service determines that it needs to obtain a
       Replacement Txn-Token.  It requests a Replacement Txn-Token from
       the Txn-Token Service.  It passes the incoming Txn-Token in the
       request, along with any additional context it needs to send the
       Txn-Token Service.

   7.  The Txn-Token Service responds with a replacement Txn-Token

   8.  The service that requested the Replacement Txn-Token uses that
       Txn-Token for downstream call authorization

   9.  Responses are provided to callers based on successful
       authorization by the invoked microservices

   10. External client is provided a response to the external invocation

3.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Terminology

   Workload:  An independent computational unit that can autonomously
      receive and process invocations, and can generate invocations of
      other workloads.  Examples of workloads include containerized
      microservices, monolithic services and infrastructure services
      such as managed databases.

   Trust Domain:  A collection of systems, applications, or workloads
      that share a common security policy.  In practice this may include
      a virtually or physically separated network, which contains two or
      more workloads.  The workloads within a Trust Domain may be
      invoked only through published interfaces.

   External Endpoint:  A published interface to a Trust Domain that
      results in the invocation of a workload within the Trust Domain.

   Call Chain:  A sequence of invocations that results from the
      invocation of an external endpoint.

   Transaction Token (Txn-Token):  A signed JWT that has a short
      lifetime, which provides immutable information about the user or
      workload, certain parameters of the call and certain contextual
      attributes of the call.

   Authorization Context:  A JSON object containing a set of claims that
      represent the immutable context of a call chain.

   Transaction Token Service (Txn-Token Service):  A special service
      within the Trust Domain, which issues Txn-Tokens to requesting
      workloads.  Each Trust Domain that uses Txn-Tokens MUST have
      exactly one logical Txn-Token Service.

5.  Txn-Token Format

   A Txn-Token is a JSON Web Token [RFC7519] protected by a JSON Web
   Signature [RFC7515].  The following describes the required values in
   a Txn-Token:

5.1.  JWT Header

   In the JWT Header:

   *  The typ Header Parameter MUST be present and MUST have the value
      txntoken+jwt.

   *  Key rotation of the signing key SHOULD be supported through the
      use of a kid Header Parameter.

   Figure 3 is a non-normative example of the JWT Header of a Txn-Token

   {
       "typ": "txntoken+jwt",
       "alg": "RS256",
       "kid": "identifier-to-key"
   }

                    Figure 3: Example: Txn-Token Header

5.2.  JWT Body Claims

   The transaction token body follows the JWT format and includes
   existing JWT claims as well as defines new claims.  These claims are
   described below:

   iss:  OPTIONAL The iss claim as defined in [RFC7519] is not required
      as Txn-Tokens are bound to a single trust domain as defined by the
      aud claim and often the signing keys are known.  The iss claim
      MUST be used in cases where the signing keys are not predetermined
      or it is desired that the Txn-Token Service signs with unique
      keys.

   iat:  REQUIRED The issued at time of the Txn-Token as defined in
      [RFC7519]

   aud:  REQUIRED This claim, defined in [RFC7519], identifies the trust
      domain in which the Txn-Token is valid.  This identifier MUST
      uniquely identify the trust domain.

   exp:  REQUIRED Expiry time of the Txn-Token as defined in [RFC7519]

   txn:  REQUIRED A unique transaction identifier as defined in
      Section 2.2 of [RFC8417].

   sub:  REQUIRED A unique identifier for the subject within the context
      of the aud trust domain.  Unlike OpenID Connect, the sub claim is
      NOT associated with the iss claim.

   purp:  REQUIRED A String defining the purpose or intent of this
      transaction.

   azd:  OPTIONAL A JSON object that contains values that remain
      immutable throughout the call chain.

   rctx:  OPTIONAL A JSON object that describes the environmental
      context of the requested transaction.

5.2.1.  Purpose claim

   The purp claim captures the exact purpose of this particular
   transaction.  This is often much narrower than a scope value issued
   to an external client.  This is due to the fact that in most cases,
   the authorization model within the trust domain is quite different
   than the authorization model used with clients external to the trust
   domain.  To that end, it is intentional to separate the concept of
   scope (often fairly coarse-grained) used with external clients from
   the purpose of the transaction used within the trust domain.  How a
   given deployment represents the authorization model within the trust
   domain is out of scope for this specification.

5.2.2.  Requester Context

   The Txn-Token SHOULD contain an rctx claim.  This MAY include the IP
   address information of the originating user, as well as information
   about the computational entity that requested the Txn-Token and
   contextual attributes of the originating request itself.

   The JSON value of the rctx claim MAY include any values the Txn-Token
   Service determines are interesting to downstream services that rely
   on the Txn-Token.  The following claims are defined so that if they
   are included, they have the following meaning:

   *  req_ip The IP address of the requester.  This MAY be the end-user
      or a robotic process that requested the Transaction

   *  authn The authentication method used to idenitfy the requester.
      Its value is a StringOrURI that uniquely identifies the method
      used.

   *  req_wl The requesting workload.  A StringOrURI that uniquely
      identifies the computational entity that requested the Txn-Token.
      This entity MUST be within the Trust Domain of the Txn-Token.  If
      a replacement Txn-Token has been requested, then this claim will
      be an array of StringOrURIs representing the different workloads
      that have requested Txn-Tokens as part of the transaction
      processing.

5.2.3.  Authorization Details

   The Txn-Token SHOULD contain an azd claim.  The value of this claim
   is a JSON object that contains name/value pairs (wherein the value
   could itself be an object), which together assert the details that
   remain immutable through the call-chain where this Txn-Token is used.

   Txn-Tokens are primarily used to assure identity and context for a
   transaction, and the content of this field is a critical part of that
   context.

   Whereas the rctx field contains environmental values related to the
   request, the azd field contains the actual authorizaton details that
   are determined by the TTS.  These values are used by services using
   the Txn-Token to reliably obtain specific parameters needed to
   perform their work.  The content of the azd field is determined by
   the Txn-Token Service and they may be computed internally or from
   parameters it receives from the service that requests the Txn-Token.

   The following is a non-normative example of an azd claim:

   "azd": {
     "action": "BUY", // parameter of external call
     "ticker": "MSFT", // parameter of external call
     "quantity": "100", // parameter of external call
     "customer_type": { // computed value not present in external call
       "geo": "US",
       "level": "VIP"
     }
   }

5.2.3.1.  Requesting Workload Identifier

   It is useful to be able to track the set of workloads that have
   requested a Txn-Token.  The req_wl claim allows for tracking this
   information even through requests for a replacement Txn-Token.  By
   default, the req_wl is a StringOrURI representing the original
   workload entity that requested the Txn-Token.  However, if a workload
   within the path of servicing the transaction requests a replacement
   Txn-Token, then the Transaction Token Service will append the new
   requesting workload as a subsequent array element in the req_wl
   claim.  This provides a "pathing" mechanism to track which services
   have requested replacement Txn-Tokens.  If there is only a single
   value the req_wl will be a StringOrURI.  If there is more than a
   single value, then req_wl will be represented by an array of
   StringOrURIs.

   {
       "rctx": {
         "req_ip": "69.151.72.123", // env context of external call
         "authn": "urn:ietf:rfc:6749", // env context of the external call
         "req_wl": [ "apigateway.trust-domain.example", "workload3.trust-domain.example" ]
       }
   }

5.2.4.  Example

   The figure below Figure 4 shows a non-normative example of the JWT
   body of a Txn-Token:

   {
     "iat": 1686536226,
     "aud": "trust-domain.example",
     "exp": 1686536586,
     "txn": "97053963-771d-49cc-a4e3-20aad399c312",
     "sub": "d084sdrt234fsaw34tr23t",
     "rctx": {
       "req_ip": "69.151.72.123", // env context of external call
       "authn": "urn:ietf:rfc:6749", // env context of the external call
       "req_wl": "apigateway.trust-domain.example" // the internal entity that requested the Txn-Token
     },
     "purp" : "trade.stocks",
     "azd": {
       "action": "BUY", // parameter of external call
       "ticker": "MSFT", // parameter of external call
       "quantity": "100", // parameter of external call
       "customer_type": { // computed value not present in external call
         "geo": "US",

       }
     }
   }

6.  Txn-Token Service

   A Txn-Token Service defines a profile of the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange
   [RFC8693] endpoint that can respond to Txn-Token issuance requests.
   This profile of the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange [RFC8693] specification
   MUST be used to obtain Txn-Tokens.  The unique properties of the Txn-
   Token requests and responses are described below.  The Txn-Token
   Service MAY optionally support other OAuth 2.0 endpoints and
   features, but that is not a requirement for it to be a Txn-Token
   Service.

   Each Trust Domain that uses Txn-Tokens MUST have exactly one logical
   Txn-Token Service.

7.  Requesting Txn-Tokens

   A workload requests a Txn-Token from a Transaction Token Service
   using a profile of the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange [RFC8693].  Txn-
   Tokens may be requested for both externally originating or internally
   originating requests.  The profile describes how required and
   optional context can be provided to the Transaction Token Service in
   order for the Txn-Token to be issued.  The request to obtain a Txn-
   Token using this method is called a Txn-Token Request, and a
   successful response is called a Txn-Token Response.  The Txn-Token
   profile of the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange [RFC8693] is described below.

7.1.  Txn-Token Request

   A workload requesting a Txn-Token must provide the Transaction Token
   Service with proof of its identity (client authentication), the
   purpose of the Txn-Token and optionally any additional context
   relating to the transaction being performed.  Most of these elements
   are provided by the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange specification and the
   rest are defined as new parameters.  Additionally, this profile
   defines a new token type URN urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-
   type:txn_token which is used by the requesting workload to identify
   that it is requesting the Txn-Token Response to contain a Txn-Token.

   To request a Txn-Token the workload invokes the OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749]
   token endpoint with the following parameters:

   *  grant_type REQUIRED.  The value MUST be set to
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange

   *  audience REQUIRED.  The value MUST be set to the Trust Domain name

   *  scope REQUIRED.  A space-delimited list of case-sensitive strings
      where the value(s) MUST represent the specific purpose or intent
      of the transaction.

   *  requested_token_type REQUIRED.  The value MUST be
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:txn_token

   *  subject_token REQUIRED.  The value MUST represent the subject of
      the transaction.  This MAY be:

      -  An inbound token received by an API Gateway

      -  A self-signed JWT constructed by a workload initiating a
         transaction

      -  An unsigned JSON object constructed by a workload initiating a
         transaction

      -  Any other format that is understood by the Txn-Token Service

      The type of the subject_token field is identified by
      subject_token_type.

   *  subject_token_type REQUIRED.  The value MUST indicate the type of
      the token or value present in the subject_token parameter

   The following additional parameters MAY be present in a Txn-Token
   Request:

   *  request_context OPTIONAL.  This parameter contains a base64url
      encoded JSON object which represents the context of this
      transaction.  The parameter SHOULD be present and how the
      Transaction Token Service uses this parameter is out of scope for
      this specification.

   *  request_details OPTIONAL.  This parameter contains a base64url
      encoded JSON object which represents additional details of the
      transaction that MUST remain immutable throughout the processing
      of the transaction by multiple workloads.

   The requesting workload MUST authenticate its identity to the
   Transaction Token Service.  The exact client authentication mechanism
   used is outside the scope of this specification.

   The figure below Figure 5 shows a non-normative example of a Txn-
   Token Request.

   POST /txn-token-service/token_endpoint HTTP 1.1

                    Figure 5: Example: Txn-Token Request

7.2.  Subject Token Types

   The subject_token_type parameter value MUST be a URI [RFC3986].  It
   MAY be:

   *  Any one of the subject token types described in Section 3 of OAuth
      2.0 Token Exchange [RFC8693] except the Refresh Token type (i.e.,
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token).

   *  A URN type name when the subject token is a self-signed JWT, as
      described below.

   *  A URN type name when the subject token is an unsigned JSON object,
      as described below.

   *  A custom URN agreed to between requesters and the Txn-Token
      Service.  The Txn-Token Service MAY support other token formats,
      which MAY be specified in the subject_token_type parameter.

7.2.1.  Self-Signed Subject Token Type

   A requester MAY use a self-signed JWT as a subject_token value.  In
   that case, the requester MUST set the subject_token_type value to:
   urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:self_signed.  This self-signed JWT
   MUST contain the following claims:

   *  iss: The unique identifier of the requesting workload.  The Txn-
      Token Service SHALL use this value in determining the req_wl value
      in the Txn-Token issued in response to this request.

   *  sub: The subject for whom the Txn-Token is being requested.  The
      Txn-Token Service SHALL use this value in determining the sub
      value in the Txn-Token issued in the response to this request.

   *  aud: The unique identifier of the Txn-Token Service.  The Txn-
      Token Service SHALL verify that this value matches its own unique
      identifier.

   *  iat: The time at which the self-signed JWT was created.  Note that
      the Txn-Token Service may reject self-signed tokens with an iat
      value that is unreasonably far in the past or future.

   *  exp: The expiration time for the JWT.  This should be a very short
      duration (order of seconds) in order to prevent any abuse of the
      JWT.

   The self-signed JWT MAY contain other claims.

7.2.2.  Unsigned JSON Object Subject Token Type

   A requester MAY use an unsigned JSON object as a subject_token value.
   In that case, the requester MUST set the subject_token_type value to:
   urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:unsigned_json.  The value of the
   subject_token field MUST be the BASE64URL encoded value of the JSON
   object as described in Section 5 of [RFC6848].  The JSON object in
   the subject token MUST contain the following fields:

   *  sub: The subject for whom the Txn-Token is being requested.  The
      Txn-Token Service SHALL use this value in determining the sub
      value in the Txn-Token issued in the response to this request.

   *  exp: The expiration time of the unsigned JSON object, which the
      TTS MAY use as input to determining the lifetime of the Txn-token.

   The unsigned JSON object MAY contain other fields, and the Txn-Token
   Service MAY consider them when generating the Txn-Token.

7.3.  Txn-Token Request Processing

   When the Transaction Token Service receives a Txn-Token Request it
   MUST validate the requesting workload client authentication and
   determine if that workload is authorized to obtain the Txn-Tokens
   with the requested values.  The authorization policy for determining
   such issuance is out of scope for this specification.

   Next, the Transaction Token Service MUST validate the subject_token
   and determine the value to specify as the sub of the issued Txn-
   Token.  The Txn-Token Service MUST ensure the sub value is unique
   within the trust domain defined by the aud claim.

   The Transaction Token Service MUST set the iat claim to the time of
   issuance of the Txn-Token.

   The Transaction Token Service MUST set the aud claim to an identifier
   representing the Trust Domain of the Transaction Token Service.  If
   the Transaction Token Service supports multiple trust domains, then
   it MUST determine the correct aud value for this request.

   The Transaction Token Service MUST set the exp claim to the expiry
   time of the Txn-Token.  The Txn-Token Service MAY consider any exp
   value present in the subject_token parameter of the Txn-Token Request
   in determining the exp value of the resulting Txn-Token.

   The Transaction Token Service MUST set the txn claim to a unique ID
   specific to this transaction.

   The Transaction Token Service MAY set the iss claim of the Txn-Token
   to a value defining the entity that signed the Txn-Token.  This claim
   MUST be omitted if not set.

   The Transaction Token Service MUST evaluate the value specified in
   the scope parameter of the request to determine the purp claim of the
   issued Txn-Token.

   If a request_context parameter is present in the Txn-Token Request,
   the data SHOULD be added to the rctx object of the Txn-Token.  In
   addition, the Transaction Token Service SHOULD add the authenticated
   requesting workload identifier in the rctx object as the req_wl
   claim.

   If a request_details parameter is present in the Txn-Token Request,
   then the Transaction Token Service SHOULD propagate the data from the
   request_details object into the claims in the azd object as
   authorized by the Transaction Token Service authorization policy for
   the requesting client.

   The Transaction Token Service MAY provide additional processing and
   verification that is outside the scope of this specification.

7.4.  Txn-Token Response

   A successful response to a Txn-Token Request by a Transaction Token
   Service is called a Txn-Token Response.  If the Transaction Token
   Service responds with an error, the error response is as described in
   Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].  The following values defined in [RFC8693]
   MUST be included in the Txn-Token Response:

   *  The token_type value MUST be set to N_A per guidance in OAuth 2.0
      Token Exchange [RFC8693]

   *  The access_token value MUST be the Txn-Token JWT

   *  The issued_token_type value MUST bet set to
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:txn_token

   The Txn-Token Response MUST NOT include the values expires_in,
   refresh_token and scope

   Figure 6 shows a non-normative example of a Txn-Token Response.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "token_type": "N_A",
     "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:txn_token",
     "access_token": "eyJCI6IjllciJ9...Qedw6rx"
   }

                   Figure 6: Example: Txn-Token Response

7.5.  Creating Replacement Txn-Tokens

   A workload within a call chain may request the Transaction Token
   Server to replace a Txn-Token.

   Workloads MAY request replacement Txn-Tokens in order to change (add
   to, remove or modify) the asserted values within a Txn-Token.

   The values of the sub and aud claims MUST remain unchanged in a
   replacement Txn-Token.  If the claim rctx is present in the original
   Txn-Token, then it MUST be present and unchanged in the replacement
   Txn-Token except for the req_wl claim which MUST be updated to
   include the requesting workload identifier.

7.5.1.  Txn-Token Service Responsibilities

   When issuing replacement Txn-Tokens, a Txn-Token Service:

   *  MAY enable modifications to asserted values that reduce the scope
      of permitted actions

   *  MAY enable additional asserted values

   *  SHOULD NOT enable modification to asserted values that expand the
      scope of permitted actions

   *  MUST NOT modify sub and aud values of the Txn-Token in the request

   *  MUST NOT remove any of the existing requesting workload
      identifiers from the req_wl field in the rctx claim of the Txn-
      Token

7.5.2.  Replacement Txn-Token Request

   To request a replacement Txn-Token, the requester makes a Txn-Token
   Request as described in Section 7.1 but includes the Txn-Token to be
   replaced as the value of the subject_token parameter.  The scope
   value in the replacement request, if different from that in the
   original Txn-Token, MUST NOT increase the authorization surface
   beyond that of the original Txn-Token.

7.5.3.  Replacement Txn-Token Response

   A successful response by the Txn-Token Service to a Replacement Txn-
   Token Request is a Txn-Token Response as described in Section 7.4

7.6.  Mutual Authentication of the Txn-Token Request

   A Txn-Token Service MUST ensure that it authenticates any workloads
   requesting Txn-Tokens.  In order to do so:

   *  It MUST name a limited, pre-configured set of workloads that MAY
      request Txn-Tokens

   *  It MUST individually authenticate the requester as being one of
      the named requesters

   *  It SHOULD rely on mechanisms, such as [SPIFFE] used in conjunction
      with MTLS [RFC8446], or some other means of performing MTLS, to
      securely authenticate the requester

   *  It SHOULD NOT rely on insecure mechanisms, such as long-lived
      shared secrets to authenticate the requesters

   The requesting workload MUST have a pre-configured location for the
   Transaction Token Service.  It SHOULD rely on mechanisms, such as
   [SPIFFE], to securely authenticate the Transaction Token Service
   before making a Txn-Token Request.

8.  Using Txn-Tokens

   Txn-Tokens need to be communicated between workloads that depend upon
   them to authorize the request.  Such workloads will often present
   HTTP [RFC9110] interfaces for being invoked by other workloads.  This
   section specifies the HTTP header the invoking workload MUST use to
   communicate the Txn-Token to the invoked workload, when the invoked
   workload presents an HTTP interface.  Note that the standard HTTP
   Authorization header MUST NOT be used because that may be used by the
   workloads to communicate channel authorization.

8.1.  Txn-Token HTTP Header

   A workload that invokes another workload using HTTP and needs to
   present a Txn-Token to the invoked workload MUST use the HTTP Header
   Txn-Token to communicate the Txn-Token.  The value of this header
   MUST be the JWT that represents the Txn-Token.

9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Txn-Token Lifetime

   A Txn-Token is not resistant to replay attacks.  A long-lived Txn-
   Token therefore represents a risk if it is stored in a file,
   discovered by an attacker, and then replayed.  For this reason, a
   Txn-Token lifetime must be kept short, not exceeding the lifetime of
   a call-chain.  Even for long-running "batch" jobs, a longer lived
   access token should be used to initiate the request to the batch
   endpoint.  It then obtains short-lived Txn-Tokens that may be used to
   authorize the call to downstream services in the call-chain.

   Because Txn-Tokens are short-lived, the Txn-Token response from the
   Txn-Token service does not contain the refresh_token field.  A Txn-
   Token cannot be issued by presenting a refresh_token.

   The expires_in and scope fields of the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange
   specification [RFC8693] are also not used in Txn-Token responses.
   The expires_in is not required since the issued token has an exp
   field, which indicates the token lifetime.  The scope field is
   omitted from the response in favor of the purp claim in the Txn-
   Token.

9.2.  Access Tokens

   When creating Txn-Tokens, the Txn-Token MUST NOT contain the Access
   Token presented to the external endpoint.  If an Access Token is
   included in a Txn-Token, an attacker may extract the Access Token
   from the Txn-Token, and replay it to any Resource Server that can
   accept that Access Token.  Txn-Token expiry does not protect against
   this attack since the Access Token may remain valid even after the
   Txn-Token has expired.

9.3.  Subject Token Types

   A service requesting a Txn-Token SHOULD provide an incoming token if
   it has one that it used itself to authorize a caller, and if it
   directly correlates with the downstream call chain it needs the Txn-
   Token for.  In the absence of an appropriate incoming token, the
   requesting service MAY use a self-signed JWT, an unsigned JSON object
   or any other format to represent the details of the requester to the
   Txn-Token service.

9.4.  Client Authentication

   How requesting clients authenticate to the Transaction Token Service
   is out of scope for this specification.  However, if using the
   actor_token and actor_token_type parameters of the OAuth 2.0 Token
   Exchange specification, both parameters MUST be present in the
   request.  The actor_token MUST authenticate the identity of the
   requesting workload.

9.5.  Replacement Tokens

   Validation of a replacement Txn-Token, as well as any Txn-Token, is
   critical to the security of the entire transaction invocation
   sequence.  Only Txn-Tokens issued by a trusted Transaction Token
   Service may be trusted, so verification of the Txn-Token signature is
   required.  For replacement transaction tokens, not only must the JWT
   signature be verified but also the workload identity of the workload
   requesting the replacement Txn-Token.

9.6.  Scope and Purpose processing

   The authorization model within a trust domain boundary is most often
   quite different from the authorization model (e.g.  OAuth scopes)
   used with client external to the trust domain.  This makes managing
   unintentional scope increase a critical aspect of the Transaction
   Token Service.  The TTS MUST ensure that the requested purpose
   (scope) of the Txn-Token is equal or less than the scope(s)
   identified in the subject_token.  This is also true of requesting a
   replacement Txn-Token.  The TTS MUST ensure there is not
   unintentional increase in authorization scope.

9.7.  Identifying Call Chains

   A Txn-token typically represents the call-chain of workloads
   necessary to complete a logical function initiated by an external or
   internal workload.  The txn claim in the Txn-token provides a unique
   identifier that when logged by the TTS and each subsequent workload
   can provide both discovery and auditability of successful and failed
   transactions.  It is therefore strongly RECOMMENDED to use an
   identifier, unique within the trust domain, for the txn value.

10.  Privacy Considerations

10.1.  Obfuscation of Personal Information

   Some rctx claims may be considered personal information in some
   jurisdictions and if so their values need to be obfuscated.  For
   example, originating IP address (req_ip) is often considered personal
   information and in that case must be protected through some
   obfuscation method (e.g. salted SHA256).

10.2.  Logging

   Txn-Tokens SHOULD NOT be logged if they contain Personally
   Identifiable Information (PII).  What constitutes PII depends upon
   the use case, but in some cases even an email address (which could be
   a sub value) can be protected PII, which should not be logged.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers the following token type identifiers to
   the "OAuth URI" subregistry of the "OAuth Parameters"
   [IANA.OAuth.Parameters] registry.  It also registers the following
   claims defined in Section Section 5.2 in the IANA JSON Web Token
   Claims Registry defined in [RFC7519].  It also registers the Media
   Type [IANA.MediaTypes] "txntoken+jwt" as defined in the section
   Section 5.1.

11.3.  IANA Media Type Registration Contents

   The following entry will be proposed using the IANA Media Type
   registration [IANA.MediaTypes] form.

   *  Applicant Name: Atul Tulshibagwale

   *  Applicant Email: atul@sgnl.ai

   *  Type Name: "application (RFC 2046)"

   *  Subtype Name: "txntoken+jwt"

   *  Required Parameters: "N/A."

   *  Optional Parameters: "N/A."

   *  Encoding Considerations: 7-bit text

   *  Security Considerations:

      1.  The media type is used to identify JWTs that may be used as
          Transaction Tokens.  It is a piece of data, and may not
          contain executable content.

      2.  Transaction Tokens are short-lived tokens used within a
          trusted environment, so there are no privacy considerations.
          Transaction Tokens are unmodifiable tokens, which need
          integrity protection.

      3.  The JWTs representing Transaction Tokens are signed, and
          therefore are integrity protected.  A recipient of a
          Transaction Token must verify the signature on the Transaction
          Token before using it.

      4.  There are no additional security considerations specific to
          the use of JWTs as Transaction Tokens

      5.  The Transaction Tokens format does not require the use of
          links within the token.  If links are used by specific
          instances of Transaction Tokens, then their interpretation is
          usage specific

   *  Interoperability Considerations: Transaction Tokens inherit all

11.4.  HTTP Header

   The header name Txn-Token is proposed to be added to the HTTP Field
   Name Registry [IANA.HTTP.FieldNames].  This header is defined in the
   section Section 8.1.  The following entry will be proposed in the
   HTTP Field Name Registry:

   *  Field Name: Txn-Token

   *  Status: permanent

   *  Specification Document: Section Section 8.1 of this document

   *  Comment: The Authorization header cannot be used for Txn-tokens
      because that may be used for service-to-service authorization, and
      the services may simultaneously require the use of Txn-tokens to
      convey detailed immutable information such as user identity and
      details of fine-grained authorization that are included in the
      Txn-token.
